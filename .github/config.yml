  Hello!ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for contributing to the dbt product documentation and opening this pull request! âœ¨ 
  
  The dbt Labs docs are written in Markdown and sometimes HTML. When writing content, refer to the [style guide](https://github.com/dbt-labs/docs.getdbt.com#:~:text=refer%20to%20the-,style%20guide,-and%20content%20types) and [content types](https://github.com/dbt-labs/docs.getdbt.com/blob/current/contributing/content-types.md) to learn more about our writing standards and how we organize information in the product docs.
  
  We'll do our best to get back to you as soon as we can. ðŸ˜„
