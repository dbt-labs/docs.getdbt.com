## Contributing

The dbt Developer Blog is a place where analytics practitioners can go to share their knowledge with the community. Analytics Engineering is a discipline we’re all  building together. The developer blog exists to cultivate the collective knowledge that exists on how to build and scale effective data teams.

We currently have editorial capacity for 10 Community contributed developer blogs per quarter - if we are oversubscribed we suggest you post on another platform or hold off until the editorial team is ready to take on more posts.

### What makes a good developer blog post?

- The short answer: Practical, hands on analytics engineering tutorials and stories

### How do I submit a proposed post?

To submit a proposed post, open a `Contribute to the dbt Developer Blog` issue on the [Developer Hub repo](https://github.com/dbt-labs/docs.getdbt.com/issues/new/choose). You will be asked for:

- A short (one paragraph) summary of the post you’d like to publish
- An outline of the post

You’ll hear back from a member of the dbt Labs teams within 7 days with one of three responses:

- The post looks good to go as is! We’ll ask you to start creating a draft based off of the initial outline you submitted
- Proposed changes to the outline. This could be additional focus on a topic you mention that’s of high community interest or a tweak to the structure to help with narrative flow
- Not a fit for the developer blog right now. We hugely appreciate *any* interest in submitting to the Developer Blog - right now our biggest backlog is capacity to help folks get these published. See below on how we are thinking about and evaluating potential posts.

### What is the process once my blog is accepted?

Once a blog is accepted, we’ll ask you for a date when we can expect the draft by. Typically we’ll ask that you can commit to having this ready within a month of submitting the issue.

Once you submit a draft, we’ll return a first set of edits within 5 business days.

The typical turnaround time from issue creation to going live on the developer blog is ~4 to 6 weeks.

### What happens after my blog is published?

We’ll share the blog on the dbt Labs social media channels! We also encourage you to share on the dbt Slack in #i-made-this.

### What if my post doesn’t get approved?

We want to publish as many community contributors as possible, but not every post will be a fit for the Developer Blog. That’s ok! There are many different reasons why we might not be able to publish a post right now and none of them reflect on the quality of the proposed post.

- **dbt Labs capacity**: We’re committed to providing hands-on feedback and coaching throughout the process. Our goal is not just to generate great developer blogs - it’s to help build a community of great writers / practitioners who can share their knowledge with the community for years to come. This necessarily means we will be able to take on a lower absolute number of posts in the short term, but will hopefully be helpful for the community long term.
- **Focus on narrative / problem solving - not industry trends**: The developer blog exists, primarily, to tell the stories of analytics engineering practitioners and how they solve problems. The idea is that reading the developer blog gives a feel for what it is like to be a data practitioner on the ground today. This is not a hard and fast rule, but a good way to approach this is “How I/we solved X problem” rather than “How everyone should solve X problem”.

We are very interested in stacks, new tools and integrations and will happily publish posts about this - with the caveat that the *focus* of the post should be solving real world problems. Hopefully if you are writing about these, this is something that you have used yourself in a hands on, production implementation.

- **Right sized scope**: We want to be able to cover a topic in-depth and dig into the nuances. Big topics like “How should you structure your data team” or “How to ensure data quality in your organization” will be tough to cover in the scope of a single post. If you have a big idea - try subdividing it! “How should you structure your data team” could become “How we successfully partnered with our RevOps team on improving lead tracking” and “How to ensure data quality in your organization” might be “How we cleaned up our utm tracking”.

### What if I need help / have questions:

- Feel free to post any questions in #community-writers on the dbt Slack.

## Core Principles

- 🧑🏻‍🤝‍🧑🏾 The dbt Developer blog is written by humans  **- individual analytics professionals sharing their insight with the world. To the extent feasible, a community member posting on the developer blog is not staking an official organizational stance, but something that *they* have learned or believe based on their work. This is true for dbt Labs employees as well.
- 💍 Developer blog content is knowledge rich - these are posts that readers share, bookmark and come back to time and time again.
- ⛹🏼‍♂️ Developer blog content is written by and for *practitioners* - end users of analytics tools (and sometimes people that work with practitioners).
- ⭐ Developer blog content is best when it is *the story which the author is uniquely positioned to tell.* Authors are encouraged to consider what insight they have that is specific to them and the work they have done.
- 🏎️  Developer blog content is actionable - readers walk away with a clear sense of how they can use this information to be a more effective practitioner. Posts include code snippets, Loom walkthroughs and hands-on, practical information that can be integrated into daily workflows.
- 🤏 Nothing is too small to share - what you think is simple has the potential to change someone's week.
- 🔮 Developer blog content is present focused —posts tell a story of a thing that you've already done or are actively doing, not something that you may do in the future.
