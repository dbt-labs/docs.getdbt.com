## Documentation contributor code of conduct

dbt Labs is privileged to have a passionate community of supporters from all over the world. The contributors to the community represent the very best of what we can accomplish when people work collaboratively. The code of conduct is the cornerstone of informative, accessible, and inclusive documentation.

### Be inclusive

It is critical that all of dbt Labs documentation is inclusive and respectful of the audience, which consists of people in widely varying circumstances from all over the planet. When writing documentation, use words that are inclusive, anti-racist, and accessible.

Individual words might be small, but together they can create community, belonging, and equity. Be empathetic in all word and style choices. Be accurate when referring to people and communities.

### Be respectful

dbt Labs greatly admire the people who use dbt, partner with the organization, and implement our open source code. We strive for the tone of our documentation to reflect this and never make the reader feel patronized.

Please don't use a disparaging tone when writing about another organization’s product or services. Remain neutral (or positive) and remove any personal feelings you might have from the content.

Through mutual respect for one another, we can enlighten the world.

### Be mindful

Users represent a wide variety of positions in organizations across the world. The goal is to make our documents as appealing and easy to understand to as many people as possible. The dbt Labs style guide is a framework, but the experience you bring to the docs is what will give the most value to our readers.

dbt Labs currently only publishes the content in English, but there are many users who are not native speakers. Keep the wording clear and professional. Avoid idioms, jokes, and anything else that might muddle the point.

Write in straightforward language that requires minimal effort to parse or translate. This helps us reach a wider audience.

### Be collaborative

Community members and dbt Labs staff are in this together. We are a passionate group working towards a common goal — making dbt accessible to everyone. Just as we value community feedback, we are prepared to give feedback to all contributors, fostering an environment of friendly and respectful conversation. Together we can accomplish more than we ever could as individuals. You are an integral part of dbt Labs, and your enthusiasm for collaboration is essential to dbt Labs success.
