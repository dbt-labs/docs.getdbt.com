In software engineering, environments are used to enable engineers to develop and test code without impacting the users of their software. Typically, there are two types of environments in dbt:

- **Deployment or Production** (or _prod_) &mdash; Refers to the environment that end users interact with. 

- **Development** (or _dev_) &mdash; Refers to the environment that engineers work in. This means that engineers can work iteratively when writing and testing new code in _development_. Once they are confident in these changes, they can deploy their code to _production_.

In traditional software engineering, different environments often use completely separate architecture. For example, the dev and prod versions of a website may use different servers and databases. <Term id="data-warehouse">Data warehouses</Term> can also be designed to have separate environments &mdash; the _production_ environment refers to the relations (for example, schemas, tables, and <Term id="view">views</Term>) that your end users query (often through a BI tool).

Configure environments to tell dbt Cloud or dbt Core how to build and execute your project in development and production:
