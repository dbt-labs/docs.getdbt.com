[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/dbt-labs/docs.getdbt.com/discussions) are the dbt community’s platform for long-lived discussions about dbt, analytics engineering, and analytics. They’re a place for us to build up a long-lasting knowledge base around the common challenges, opportunities, and patterns we work with every day. Discussions are different from the dbt Community Slack in a few key ways, most importantly they are more:

- **Asynchronous** and **long-lived** - sometimes conversations continue over weeks, months, and beyond.
- **Intentional** - we recommend taking at least 5 to 10 minutes thinking about and shaping your initial post and any comments.
- **Citable** - Slack conversations tend to be great in the moment but get lost in the flow — Discussions can more easily shared and referenced.

**Guidelines for engaging on Discussions**

The community [Rules of the Road](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/contributing/slack-rules-of-the-road) apply on GitHub Discussions, and following them is the best way to get momentum behind your Discussion or answers to your questions. The following guidelines will set you up for success:

- Be respectful
- Put effort into your posts
- For Q&A Discussions, [mark your question as resolved](https://github.com/dbt-labs/docs.getdbt.com/discussions/1621)
- Don’t double post

## Discussion categories

Discussions are broken down into three categories:

- [I need help with](https://github.com/dbt-labs/docs.getdbt.com/discussions/categories/i-need-help-with)
    - This is a Q&A style forum where you can ask the dbt Community for help with specific questions about dbt, dbt Cloud, data modeling, or anything else you want a definitive answer on.
    - This category is for questions which can **plausibly *have a single correct answer*.
        - ✅ How do I debug this Jinja error?
        - ✅ How do I set up CI in dbt Cloud on Github?
        - ❌ What is the best way to do marketing attribution?  (More general Discussions like this are perfect for the [I’m thinking about](https://github.com/dbt-labs/docs.getdbt.com/discussions/categories/i-m-thinking-about) category)
- [How I do this](https://github.com/dbt-labs/docs.getdbt.com/discussions/categories/how-i-do-this)
    - This is the forum to show off all of the cool things you are doing in dbt. Whether it’s a new macro, design pattern, or package, post here to show the community what you are up to!
- [I’m thinking about](https://github.com/dbt-labs/docs.getdbt.com/discussions/categories/i-m-thinking-about)
    - Share anything you’re thinking about that has to do with dbt or analytics engineering! This is a great place to jot down some thoughts to share with the community or spark a discussion on a topic that’s currently interesting you.
    - If you have meta questions about Discussions or the dbt Community - this would also be the place to discuss these.

## Following new and ongoing Discussions

To see new discussions, you can either directly browse Discussions on GitHub or follow the #dbt-discussions channel on Slack. You can also follow specific Discussions to get notifications on Github, and any discussions you’re participating in will trigger Github notifications as well.
