## Connection Methods


### Configuring your AWS profile for Glue Interactive Session
There are two IAM principals used with interactive sessions.
- Client principal: The princpal (either user or role) calling the AWS APIs (Glue, Lake Formation, Interactive Sessions)
from the local client. This is the principal configured in the AWS CLI and likely the same.
- Service role: The IAM role that AWS Glue uses to execute your session. This is the same as AWS Glue
ETL.

Read [this documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/glue-is-security.html) to configure these principals.


You will find bellow a least privileged policy to enjoy all features of **`dbt-glue`** adapter.

Please to update variables between **`<>`**, here are explanations of these arguments:

|Args	|Description	|
|---|---|
|region|The region where your Glue database is stored |
|AWS Account|The AWS account where you run your pipeline|
|dbt output database|The database updated by dbt (this is the database configured in the profile.yml of your dbt environment)|
|dbt source database|All databases used as source|
|dbt output bucket|The bucket name where the data will be generated by dbt (the location configured in the profile.yml of your dbt environment)|
|dbt source bucket|The bucket name of source databases (if they are not managed by Lake Formation)|

### Configuration of the local environment

Because **`dbt`** and **`dbt-glue`** adapter are compatible with Python versions 3.8, and 3.9, check the version of Python:

```bash
$ python3 --version
```

Configure a Python virtual environment to isolate package version and code dependencies:

```bash
$ sudo yum install git
$ python3 -m venv dbt_venv
$ source dbt_venv/bin/activate
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Configure the last version of AWS CLI

```bash
$ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
$ unzip awscliv2.zip
$ sudo ./aws/install
```

Configure the aws-glue-session package

```bash
$ sudo yum install gcc krb5-devel.x86_64 python3-devel.x86_64 -y
$ pip3 install —upgrade boto3
$ pip3 install —upgrade aws-glue-sessions
```

### Example config
<File name='profiles.yml'>

```yml
type: glue
query-comment: This is a glue dbt example
role_arn: arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/GlueInteractiveSessionRole
region: us-east-1
workers: 2
worker_type: G.1X
idle_timeout: 10
schema: "dbt_demo"
database: "dbt_demo"
session_provisioning_timeout_in_seconds: 120
location: "s3://dbt_demo_bucket/dbt_demo_data"
```

## Caveats

### Supported Functionality

Most dbt Core functionality is supported, but some features are only available with Apache Hudi.

Apache Hudi-only features:
1. Incremental model updates by `unique_key` instead of `partition_by` (see [`merge` strategy](/reference/resource-configs/glue-configs#the-merge-strategy))

Some dbt features, available on the core adapters, are not yet supported on Glue:
1. [Persisting](/reference/resource-configs/persist_docs) column-level descriptions as database comments
2. [Snapshots](/docs/build/snapshots)
