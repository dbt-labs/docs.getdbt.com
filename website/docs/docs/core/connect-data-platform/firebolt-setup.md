For other information including Firebolt feature support, see the [GitHub README](https://github.com/firebolt-db/dbt-firebolt/blob/main/README.md) and the [changelog](https://github.com/firebolt-db/dbt-firebolt/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).


## Connecting to Firebolt

To connect to Firebolt from dbt, you'll need to add a [profile](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connection-profiles) to your `profiles.yml` file. A Firebolt profile conforms to the following syntax:

<File name='profiles.yml'>

```yml
<profile-name>:
  target: <target-name>
  outputs:
    <target-name>:
      type: firebolt
      client_id: "<id>"
      client_secret: "<secret>"
      database: "<database-name>"
      engine_name: "<engine-name>"
      account_name: "<account-name>"
      schema: <tablename-prefix>
      threads: 1
      #optional fields
      host: "<hostname>"
```

</File>


#### Description of Firebolt Profile Fields

To specify values as environment variables, use the format `{{ env_var('<variable_name>' }}`. For example, `{{ env_var('DATABASE_NAME' }}`.

| Field                    | Description |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `type`                   | This must be included either in `profiles.yml` or in the `dbt_project.yml` file. Must be set to `firebolt`. |
| `client_id`                   | Required. Your [service account](https://docs.firebolt.io/godocs/Guides/managing-your-organization/service-accounts.html) id. |
| `client_secret`               | Required. The secret associated with the specified `client_id`. |
| `database`               | Required. The name of the Firebolt database to connect to. |
| `engine_name`            | Required in version 0.21.10 and later. Optional in earlier versions. The name (not the URL) of the Firebolt engine to use in the specified `database`. This must be a general purpose read-write engine and the engine must be running. If omitted in earlier versions, the default engine for the specified `database` is used. |
| `account_name`           | Required. Specifies the account name under which the specified `database` exists. |
| `schema`                 | Recommended. A string to add as a prefix to the names of generated tables when using the [custom schemas workaround](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-profiles/firebolt-profile#supporting-concurrent-development). |
| `threads`                | Required. Set to higher number to improve performance. |
| `host`                   | Optional. The host name of the connection. For all customers it is `api.app.firebolt.io`, which will be used if omitted. |


#### Troubleshooting Connections

If you encounter issues connecting to Firebolt from dbt, make sure the following criteria are met:
- You must have adequate permissions to access the engine and the database.
- Your service account must be attached to a user.
- The engine must be running.


## Supporting Concurrent Development

In dbt, database schemas are used to compartmentalize developer environments so that concurrent development does not cause <Term id="table" /> name collisions. Firebolt, however, does not currently support database schemas (it is on the roadmap). To work around this, we recommend that you add the following macro to your project. This macro will take the `schema` field of your `profiles.yml` file and use it as a table name prefix.

```sql
-- macros/generate_alias_name.sql
{% macro generate_alias_name(custom_alias_name=none, node=none) -%}
    {%- if custom_alias_name is none -%}
        {{ node.schema }}__{{ node.name }}
    {%- else -%}
        {{ node.schema }}__{{ custom_alias_name | trim }}
    {%- endif -%}
{%- endmacro %}
```

For an example of how this works, letâ€™s say Shahar and Eric are both working on the same project.

In her `.dbt/profiles.yml`, Sharar sets `schema=sh`, whereas Eric sets `schema=er` in his. When each runs the `customers` model, the models will land in the database as tables named `sh_customers` and `er_customers`, respectively. When running dbt in production, you would use yet another `profiles.yml` with a string of your choice.
