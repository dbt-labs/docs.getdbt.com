## Connecting to Materialize

Once you have set up a [Materialize account](https://materialize.com/register/), adapt your `profiles.yml` to connect to your instance using the following reference profile configuration:

<File name='~/.dbt/profiles.yml'>

```yaml
materialize:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: materialize
      host: [host]
      port: [port]
      user: [user@domain.com]
      pass: [password]
      dbname: [database]
      cluster: [cluster] # default 'default'
      schema: [dbt schema]
      sslmode: require
      keepalives_idle: 0 # default: 0, indicating the system default
      connect_timeout: 10 # default: 10 seconds
      retries: 1 # default: 1, retry on error/timeout when opening connections
```

</File>

### Configurations

`cluster`: The default [cluster](https://materialize.com/docs/overview/key-concepts/#clusters) is used to maintain materialized views or indexes. A [`default` cluster](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/show-clusters/#default-cluster) is pre-installed in every environment, but we recommend creating dedicated clusters to isolate the workloads in your dbt project (for example, `staging` and `data_mart`).

`keepalives_idle`: The number of seconds before sending a ping to keep the Materialize connection active. If you are encountering `SSL SYSCALL error: EOF detected`, you may want to lower the [keepalives_idle](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-setups/postgres-setup#keepalives_idle) value to prevent the database from closing its connection.

To test the connection to Materialize, run:

```
dbt debug
```

If the output reads "All checks passed!", youâ€™re good to go! Check the [dbt and Materialize guide](https://materialize.com/docs/guides/dbt/) to learn more and get started.

## Supported Features

### Materializations

Because Materialize is optimized for transformations on streaming data and the core of dbt is built around batch, the `dbt-materialize` adapter implements a few custom materialization types:

Type | Supported? | Details
-----|------------|----------------
`source` | YES | Creates a [source](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-source/).
`view` | YES | Creates a [view](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-view/#main).
`materializedview` | YES | Creates a [materialized view](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-materialized-view/#main).
`table` | YES | Creates a [materialized view](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-materialized-view/#main). (Actual table support pending [#5266](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/5266))
`sink` | YES | Creates a [sink](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-sink/#main).
`ephemeral` | YES | Executes queries using <Term id="cte">CTEs</Term>.
`incremental` | NO | Use the `materializedview` <Term id="materialization" /> instead. Materialized views will always return up-to-date results without manual or configured refreshes. For more information, check out [Materialize documentation](https://materialize.com/docs/).

### Indexes

Materialized views (`materializedview`), views (`view`) and sources (`source`) may have a list of [`indexes`](/reference/resource-configs/materialize-configs#indexes) defined.

### Seeds

Running [`dbt seed`](/reference/commands/seed) will create a static materialized <Term id="view" /> from a CSV file. You will not be able to add to or update this view after it has been created.

### Tests

Running [`dbt test`](/reference/commands/test) with the optional `--store-failures` flag or [`store_failures` config](/reference/resource-configs/store_failures) will create a materialized view for each configured test that can keep track of failures over time.
