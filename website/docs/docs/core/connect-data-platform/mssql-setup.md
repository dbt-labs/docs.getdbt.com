:::tip Default settings change in dbt-sqlserver v1.2 / ODBC Driver 18
Microsoft made several changes related to connection encryption. Read more about the changes [below](#connection-encryption).
:::

### Prerequisites

On Debian/Ubuntu make sure you have the ODBC header files before installing

```bash
sudo apt install unixodbc-dev
```

Download and install the [Microsoft ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/download-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15).
If you already have ODBC Driver 17 installed, then that one will work as well.

#### Supported configurations

* The adapter is tested with SQL Server 2017, SQL Server 2019, SQL Server 2022 and Azure SQL Database.
* We test all combinations with Microsoft ODBC Driver 17 and Microsoft ODBC Driver 18.
* The collations we run our tests on are `SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS` and `SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CS_AS`.

The adapter support is not limited to the matrix of the above configurations. If you notice an issue with any other configuration, let us know by opening an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/dbt-msft/dbt-sqlserver).

## Authentication methods & profile configuration

### Common configuration

For all the authentication methods, refer to the following configuration options that can be set in your `profiles.yml` file. 
A complete reference of all options can be found [at the end of this page](#reference-of-all-connection-options).

| Configuration option | Description | Type | Example |
| --------------------- | ---- | ---- | ------- |
| `driver` | The ODBC driver to use | Required | `ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server` |
| `server` | The server hostname | Required | `localhost` |
| `port` |  The server port | Required | `1433` |
| `database` | The database name | Required | Not applicable |
| `schema` | The schema name | Required | `dbo` |
| `retries` | The number of automatic times to retry a query before failing. Defaults to `1`. Queries with syntax errors will not be retried. This setting can be used to overcome intermittent network issues. | Optional |  Not applicable  |
| `login_timeout` | The number of seconds used to establish a connection before failing. Defaults to `0`, which means that the timeout is disabled or uses the default system settings. | Optional |  Not applicable  |
| `query_timeout` | The number of seconds used to wait for a query before failing. Defaults to `0`, which means that the timeout is disabled or uses the default system settings. | Optional |  Not applicable  |
| `schema_authorization` |  Optionally set this to the principal who should own the schemas created by dbt. [Read more about schema authorization](#schema-authorization). | Optional |  Not applicable  |
| `encrypt` |  Whether to encrypt the connection to the server. Defaults to `true`. Read more about [connection encryption](#connection-encryption). | Optional |  Not applicable  |
| `trust_cert` |   Whether to trust the server certificate. Defaults to `false`. Read more about [connection encryption](#connection-encryption).| Optional |  Not applicable  |

### Connection encryption

Microsoft made several changes in the release of ODBC Driver 18 that affects how connection encryption is configured.
To accommodate these changes, starting in dbt-sqlserver 1.2.0 or newer the default values of `encrypt` and `trust_cert` have changed.
Both of these settings will now **always** be included in the connection string to the server, regardless if you've left them out of your profile configuration or not.

* The default value of `encrypt` is `true`, meaning that connections are encrypted by default.
* The default value of `trust_cert` is `false`, meaning that the server certificate will be validated. By setting this to `true`, a self-signed certificate will be accepted.

More details about how these values affect your connection and how they are used differently in versions of the ODBC driver can be found in the [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/dsn-connection-string-attribute?view=sql-server-ver16#encrypt).

### Standard SQL Server authentication

SQL Server credentials are supported for on-premise servers as well as Azure,
and it is the default authentication method for `dbt-sqlserver`.

When running on Windows, you can also use your Windows credentials to authenticate.

### Azure Active Directory Authentication (AAD)

While you can use the SQL username and password authentication as mentioned above,
you might opt to use one of the authentication methods below for Azure SQL.

The following additional methods are available to authenticate to Azure SQL products:

* AAD username and password
* Service principal (a.k.a. AAD Application)
* Managed Identity
* Environment-based authentication
* Azure CLI authentication
* VS Code authentication (available through the automatic option below)
* Azure PowerShell module authentication (available through the automatic option below)
* Automatic authentication

The automatic authentication setting is in most cases the easiest choice and works for all of the above.

    {label: 'AAD username & password', value: 'aad_password'},
    {label: 'Service principal', value: 'service_principal'},

### Automatic AAD principal provisioning for grants

In dbt 1.2 or newer you can use the [grants](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/grants) config block to automatically grant/revoke permissions on your models to users or groups. This is fully supported in this adapter and comes with an additional feature.

By setting `auto_provision_aad_principals` to `true` in your model configuration, you can automatically provision Azure Active Directory (AAD) principals (users or groups) that don't exist yet.

In Azure SQL, you can sign in using AAD authentication, but to be able to grant an AAD principal certain permissions, it needs to be linked in the database first. ([Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/authentication-aad-configure?view=azuresql))

Note that principals will not be deleted automatically when they are removed from the `grants` block.

### Schema authorization

You can optionally set the principal who should own all schemas created by dbt. This is then used in the `CREATE SCHEMA` statement like so:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA [schema_name] AUTHORIZATION [schema_authorization]
```

A common use case is to use this when you are authenticating with a principal who has permissions based on a group, such as an AAD group. When that principal creates a schema, the server will first try to create an individual login for this principal and then link the schema to that principal. If you would be using Azure AD in this case,
then this would fail since Azure SQL can't create logins for individuals part of an AD group automatically.
