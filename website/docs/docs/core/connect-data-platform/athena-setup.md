## Connecting to Athena with dbt-athena

This plugin does not accept any credentials directly. Instead, [credentials are determined automatically](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html) based on AWS CLI/boto3 conventions and stored login info. You can configure the AWS profile name to use via aws_profile_name. Check out the dbt profile configuration below for details.

<File name='~/.dbt/profiles.yml'>

```yaml
default:
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: athena
      s3_staging_dir: [s3_staging_dir]
      s3_data_dir: [s3_data_dir]
      s3_data_naming: [table_unique] # the type of naming convention used when writing to S3
      region_name: [region_name]
      database: [database name]
      schema: [dev_schema]
      aws_profile_name: [optional profile to use from your AWS shared credentials file.]
      threads: [1 or more]
      num_retries: [0 or more] # number of retries performed by the adapter. Defaults to 5
  target: dev
