dbt Core and almost all of its adapter plugins are open source software. As such, the codebases are freely available to download and build from source. You might install from source if you want the latest code or want to install dbt from a specific commit. This might be helpful when you are contributing changes, or if you want to debug a past change.

To download from source, you would clone the repositories from GitHub, making a local copy, and then install the local version using `pip`.

Downloading and building dbt Core will enable you to contribute to the project by fixing a bug or implementing a sought-after feature. For more details, read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Installing dbt Core

Beginning in v1.8, installing an adapter does not automatically install `dbt-core`. This is because adapters and dbt Core versions have been decoupled from each other so we no longer want to overwrite existing dbt-core installations

<VersionBlock firstVersion="1.8">

To install `dbt-core` only from the GitHub code source:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core.git
cd dbt-core
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

</VersionBlock>

<VersionBlock lastVersion="1.7">

To install `dbt-core` and `dbt-postgres` from the GitHub code source:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core.git
cd dbt-core
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
</VersionBlock>

To install in editable mode, which includes your local changes as you make them:

```shell
python -m pip install -e editable-requirements.txt` instead.
```

### Installing adapter plugins

To install an adapter plugin from source, you will need to first locate its source repository. For instance, the `dbt-redshift` adapter is located at https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-redshift.git, so you can clone it and install from there:

<VersionBlock firstVersion="1.8">

You will also need to install `dbt-core` before installing an adapter plugin.

</VersionBlock>

<VersionBlock lastVersion="1.7">

You do _not_ need to install `dbt-core` before installing an adapter plugin -- the plugin includes `dbt-core` among its dependencies, and it will install the latest compatible version automatically.
</VersionBlock>

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-redshift.git
cd dbt-redshift
python -m pip install .
```

To install in editable mode, such as while contributing, use `python -m pip install -e .` instead.
