This guide will show you how to set up dbt and perform some key tasks either in dbt Core or dbt Cloud. These tasks will illustrate how dbt establishes standard practices for your work:

* Set up a warehouse with sample data
* Connect the warehouse to dbt 
* Add a Git repository to dbt
* Execute a dbt transformation using `dbt run`
* Schedule a job or transformation

If you want a more in-depth learning experience, we recommend taking the dbt Fundamentals on our [dbt Learn online courses site](https://courses.getdbt.com/).

## Before you begin

Before you begin, you will need:

* Warehouse with sample data. If you don't have this, you can use the [BigQuery project](/docs/get-started/getting-started/getting-set-up/setting-up-bigquery), which leverages public data sets.
* Basic understanding of Git.
* Basic understanding of SQL.

## Next steps

To get started, choose the dbt product that best fits your workflow:

* [Getting started with dbt Core](/docs/get-started/getting-started-dbt-core)
