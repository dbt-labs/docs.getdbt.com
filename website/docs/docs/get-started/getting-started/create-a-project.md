Once you set up your data platform, you can create a project in dbt. When you're ready to create a project, you need to decide which interface best suits your needs for working with  dbt.

## Choose how to work with dbt

You can work with dbt in two ways:

* **dbt Cloud**: Edit files and run projects using the web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
* **dbt CLI**: Edit files locally using a code editor, and run projects using the command line interface (CLI).

To use the CLI, it's important that you know some basics of your terminal. In particular, you should understand `cd`, `ls` and `pwd` to navigate through the directory structure of your computer easily. As such, if you are new to programming, we recommend using **dbt Cloud** for this guide.

If you wish to use the CLI, please follow the [installation instructions](/docs/get-started/installation) for your operating system.
