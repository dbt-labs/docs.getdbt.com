Now that you set up your sample project and had a successful run, you can get to the fun part — [building models](/docs/build/sql-models)! You will take a sample query and turn it into a model in your dbt project. A model in dbt is a select statement.

## Checkout a new git branch

1. Click **Develop** from the upper left of dbt Cloud. You need to create a new branch since the main branch is now set to read-only mode. 

2. Click **Create branch**, and name your branch `add-customers-model`.
    <div style={{maxWidth: '400px'}}>
    <Lightbox src="/img/checkout-branch-dbt-cloud.png" title="Checkout a new branch" />
    </div>

## Build your first model

1. Click **Develop** from the upper left of dbt Cloud.
2. Click the **...** next to the Models directory, then select **Create file**.  
3. Name the file `models/customers.sql`, then click **Create**.
4. Copy the following query into the file and click **Save File**.

5. Enter `dbt run` in the command prompt at the bottom of the screen. You should get a successful run and see three models under DETAILS:
    <div style={{maxWidth: '400px'}}>
    <Lightbox src="/img/first-model-dbt-cloud.png" title="A successful run with dbt Cloud" />
    </div>

In the future, you would connect your business intelligence (BI) tools to these views and tables so they only read cleaned up data rather than raw data in your BI tool.
