After setting up a sample project with a successful run, you can get to the fun part — [building models](/docs/build/sql-models)! You will take a sample query and turn it into a model in your dbt project. A model in dbt is a select statement.

## Checkout a new git branch

1. Click **Develop** from the upper left of dbt Cloud. You need to create a new branch since the main branch is now set to read-only mode. 

2. Click **Create branch**, and name your branch `add-customers-model`.

## Build your first model

1. Click **Develop** from the upper left of dbt Cloud.
2. Click the **...** next to the Models directory, then select **Create file**.  
3. Name the file `models/customers.sql`, then click **Create**.
4. Copy the following query into the file and click **Save File**.

5. Enter `dbt run` in the command prompt at the bottom of the screen. You should get a successful run and see three models under DETAILS.

In the future, you would connect your business intelligence (BI) tools to these views and tables so they only read cleaned up data rather than raw data in your BI tool.
