Learn how to set up dbt Cloud using a sample project and one of the most common data platforms. You can select from [BigQuery](/docs/get-started/getting-started/getting-set-up/setting-up-bigquery), [Databricks](/docs/get-started/getting-started/getting-set-up/setting-up-databricks), [Redshift](/docs/get-started/getting-started/getting-set-up/setting-up-redshift), or [Snowflake](/docs/get-started/getting-started/getting-set-up/setting-up-snowflake). If you're not sure, then try [BigQuery](/docs/get-started/getting-started/getting-set-up/setting-up-bigquery).

This guide will show you how to set up dbt and perform some key tasks. These tasks will illustrate how dbt establishes standard practices for your work:

* Set up a warehouse with sample data
* Connect the warehouse to dbt
* Add a Git repository to dbt
* Execute a dbt transformation using `dbt run`
* Schedule a job or transformation

If you want a more in-depth learning experience, we recommend taking the dbt Fundamentals on our [dbt Learn online courses site](https://courses.getdbt.com/).

If you'd rather edit and run files locally using the dbt command line interface (dbt CLI) to connect to dbt Core, then you can refer to [Getting started using dbt Core](/docs/get-started/getting-started-dbt-core).
