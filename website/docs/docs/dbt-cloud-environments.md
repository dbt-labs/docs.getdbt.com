An environment determines how dbt Cloud will execute your project in the [dbt Cloud IDE](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud) or [dbt Cloud CLI](/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation) (for development) and scheduled jobs (for deployment).

Critically, in order to execute dbt, environments define three variables:

1. The version of dbt Core that will be used to run your project
2. The warehouse connection information (including the target database/schema settings)
3. The version of your code to execute

Each dbt Cloud project can have only one [development environment](#create-a-development-environment), but there is no limit to the number of [deployment environments](/docs/deploy/deploy-environments), providing you the flexibility and customization to tailor the execution of scheduled jobs. 

Use environments to customize settings for different stages of your project and streamline the execution process by using software engineering principles. This page will detail the different types of environments and how to intuitively configure your development environment in dbt Cloud.

## Create a development environment

To create a new dbt Cloud development environment:

1. Navigate to **Deploy** -> **Environments** 
2. Click **Create Environment**.
3. Select **Development** as the environment type.
4. Fill in the fields under **General Settings** and **Development Credentials**.
5. Click **Save** to create the environment.

### Set developer credentials

To use the dbt Cloud IDE or dbt Cloud CLI, each developer will need to set up [personal development credentials](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud#access-the-cloud-ide) to your warehouse connection in their **Profile Settings**. This allows you to set separate target information and maintain individual credentials to connect to your warehouse.

## Deployment environment

Deployment environments in dbt Cloud are necessary to execute scheduled jobs and use other features. A dbt Cloud project can have multiple deployment environments, allowing for flexibility and customization. However, a dbt Cloud project can only have one deployment environment that represents the production source of truth. 

To learn more about dbt Cloud deployment environments and how to configure them, visit the [Deployment environments](/docs/deploy/deploy-environments) page.
