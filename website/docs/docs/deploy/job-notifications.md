Set up notifications in dbt Cloud to receive email or Slack alerts about the status of a job run. You can choose to be notified by one or more of the following job run statuses: 

- **Succeeds** option &mdash; A job run completed successfully.
- **Warns** option &mdash; A job run encountered warnings from [tests](/docs/build/data-tests) or [source freshness](/docs/deploy/source-freshness) checks (if applicable).
- **Fails** option &mdash; A job run failed to complete. 
- **Is canceled** option &mdash; A job run is canceled.

## Email notifications

You can receive email alerts about jobs by configuring the dbt Cloud email notification settings.

### Prerequisites 
- You must be either a _developer user_ or an _account admin_ to configure email notifications in dbt Cloud. For more details, refer to [Users and licenses](/docs/cloud/manage-access/seats-and-users).
    - As a developer user, you can set up email notifications for yourself. 
    - As an account admin, you can set up notifications for yourself and other team members. 

### Configure email notifications

1. Select your profile icon and then click **Notification settings**.
1. By default, dbt Cloud sends notifications to the email address that's in your **User profile** page.

    If you're an account admin, you can choose a different email address to receive notifications. Select the **Notification email** dropdown and choose another address from the list. The list includes **Internal Users** with access to the account and **External Emails** that have been added. 
    - To add an external email address, select the **Notification email** dropdown and choose **Add external email**. After you add the external email, it becomes available for selection in the **Notification email** dropdown list. External emails can be addresses that are outside of your dbt Cloud account and also for third-party integrations like [channels in Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/tip-send-email-to-a-channel-2c17dbae-acdf-4209-a761-b463bdaaa4ca) and [PagerDuty email integration](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/email-integration-guide).

1. Click **Edit** to configure the email notification settings. Choose one or more of the run statuses for each job you want to receive notifications about.

1. When you're done with the settings, click **Save**.

    As an account admin, you can add more email recipients by choosing another **Notification email** from the dropdown, **Edit** the job notification settings, and **Save** the changes.
    
    To set up alerts on jobs from a different environment, select another **Environment** from the dropdown, **Edit** those job notification settings, and **Save** the changes.

### Unsubscribe from email notifications
1. Select your profile icon and click on **Notification settings**.
1. On the **Email notifications** page, click **Unsubscribe from all email notifications**. 

## Slack notifications

You can receive Slack alerts about jobs by setting up the Slack integration and then configuring the dbt Cloud Slack notification settings. dbt Cloud integrates with Slack via OAuth to ensure secure authentication.

### Disable the Slack integration

1. Select **Account settings** and on the **Integrations** page, scroll to the **OAuth** section.
1. Click the trash can icon (on the far right of the Slack integration) and click **Unlink**. Channels that you configured will no longer receive Slack notifications. _This is not an account-wide action._ Channels configured by other account admins will continue to receive Slack notifications if they still have active Slack integrations. To migrate ownership of a Slack channel notification configuration, have another account admin edit their configuration.
