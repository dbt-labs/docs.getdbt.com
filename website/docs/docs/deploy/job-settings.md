Jobs make it easy to run dbt commands against a project in your cloud data platform, triggered either by schedule or events. Each job run in dbt Cloud will have a run history, run status, and a run overview, which provides you with:

- Job trigger type
- Commit SHA
- Environment name
- Sources and documentation info 
- Job run details, including run timing, [model timing data](#model-timing), and [artifacts](/docs/deploy/artifacts)
- Detailed run steps with logs and their statuses

You can create a job and configure it to run on [scheduled days and times](/docs/deploy/job-triggers#schedule-days) or enter a [custom cron schedule](/docs/deploy/job-triggers#custom-cron-schedules). 

## Prerequisites

- You must have a dbt Cloud account and [Developer seat license](/docs/cloud/manage-access/seats-and-users). If you don't, you can [sign up](https://www.getdbt.com/signup/) for a [free account](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing/). 
- You must have a dbt project connected to a [data platform](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/about-connections).
- You must [create and schedule a dbt Cloud job](#create-and-schedule-jobs).
- You must have [access permission](/docs/cloud/manage-access/about-user-access) to view, create, modify, or run jobs.
- You must set up a [deployment environment](/docs/collaborate/environments/dbt-cloud-environments). 

## Create and schedule jobs {#create-and-schedule-jobs}

1. Create a new job by clicking **Deploy** in the header, click **Jobs** and then **Create job**.
1. Provide a job name, for example "Hourly Customer Job". 
1. Under **Environment**, add the following:
    * **Environment** &mdash; Link to an existing deployment environment.
    * **dbt Version** &mdash; Select the dbt [version](/docs/dbt-versions/core). dbt Labs recommends inheriting the version from the environment settings.
    * **Target Name** &mdash; Define the [target name](/docs/build/custom-target-names) for any dbt cloud job to correspond to settings in your project.
    * **Threads** &mdash; The default value is 4 [threads](/docs/core/connect-data-platform/connection-profiles#understanding-threads). Increase the thread count to increase model execution concurrency. 

1. Define [environment variables](/docs/build/environment-variables) if you want to customize the behavior of your project.

5. Under **Execution Settings**, you can configure the fields needed to execute your job:

    * **Run Timeout** &mdash; Configure the number of seconds a run will execute before dbt Cloud cancels it. Setting this to 0 means it'll never time out runs for that job.   
    * **Defer to a previous run state** &mdash; Select a production job you want to defer to. This enables dbt Cloud to examine the artifacts from the most recent, successful run of that deferred job, enabling state comparison and rewiring of upstream dependencies to any model that doesn’t exist in the current run's schema. 
    * **Generate docs on run** checkbox &mdash; Configure the job to automatically [generate project docs](/docs/collaborate/build-and-view-your-docs) each time this job runs.
    * **Run on source freshness** checkbox &mdash;  Configure [dbt source freshness](/docs/deploy/source-freshness) as the first step of the job without breaking subsequent steps.
    * **Commands** &mdash; Add or remove [job commands](/docs/deploy/job-commands), which are specific tasks you set in your dbt Cloud jobs.

6. Under the **Triggers** section, you can configure when and how dbt will trigger the job. Refer to [job triggers](/docs/deploy/job-triggers) for more details.

    * **Schedule** tab &mdash; Use the **Run on schedule** toggle to configure your job to run on [scheduled](/docs/deploy/job-triggers#schedule-days) days and time, or enter a [custom cron schedule](/docs/deploy/job-triggers#custom-cron-schedules).
    * **Continuous Integration** tab &mdash; Configure [continuous integration (CI)](/docs/deploy/continuous-integration) to run when someone opens a new pull request in your dbt repository.
    * **API** tab &mdash; Use the [dbt API](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/overview) to trigger a job.

7. Select **Save**, then click **Run Now** to run your job. Click the run and watch its progress under **Run history**.
