:::

The airgapped deployment is similiar to an on-premise installation in that the dbt Cloud instance will live in your network, and is subject to your security procedures, technologies, and controls. However, on-premises still has a number of [external network dependencies](/docs/dbt-cloud/on-premises/dependencies). An airgapped install allows you to run dbt Cloud without any of those external network dependencies and is ideal for organizations who have strict InfoSec rules around installing software from the cloud.

The installation process for airgapped is a bit different. Instead of downloading and installing images during installation time, you will download all of the necessary configuration and Docker images before starting the installation process, and manage uploading these images yourself. This means that you can remove all external network dependencies and run this application in a very secure environment.
