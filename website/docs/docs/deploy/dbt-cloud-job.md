Manage, set up, and automate your dbt jobs using robust custom job settings. You can use the job scheduler to configure when and how your jobs run, helping you keep production data fresh on a timely basis.

This portion of our documentation will go over dbt Cloud's various job settings using:

- [Job settings](/docs/deploy/job-settings) &mdash; Intuitively navigate the user interface to create new dbt jobs or edit existing ones.
- [Job commands](/docs/deploy/job-commands) &mdash; Use job commands to configure dbt commands on a schedule.
- [Job triggers](/docs/deploy/job-triggers) &mdash; You can configure when and how dbt should run your job, such as:
	* Running on scheduled days or cron schedules 
	* Setting up continuous integration (CI) to run when someone opens a new pull request in your dbt repository
	* Using the API to trigger jobs
