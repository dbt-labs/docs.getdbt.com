With dbt Cloud, you can create outbound webhooks to send events (notifications) about your dbt jobs to your other systems. Your other systems can listen for (subscribe to) these events to further automate your workflows or to help trigger automation flows you have set up.

A webhook is an HTTP-based callback function that allows event-driven communication between two different web applications. This allows you to get the latest information on your dbt jobs in real time. Without it, you would need to make API calls repeatedly to check if there are any updates that you need to account for (polling). Because of this, webhooks are also called _push APIs_ or _reverse APIs_ and are often used for infrastructure development.

dbt Cloud sends a JSON payload to your application's endpoint URL when your webhook is triggered. You can send a [Slack](/guides/zapier-slack) notification, a [Microsoft Teams](/guides/zapier-ms-teams) notification, [open a PagerDuty incident](/guides/serverless-pagerduty) when a dbt job fails. 

You can create webhooks for these events from the [dbt Cloud web-based UI](#create-a-webhook-subscription) and by using the [dbt Cloud API](#api-for-webhooks):

- `job.run.started` &mdash; Run started.
- `job.run.completed` &mdash; Run completed. This can be a run that has failed or succeeded.
- `job.run.errored` &mdash; Run errored.

dbt Cloud retries sending each event five times. dbt Cloud keeps a log of each webhook delivery for 30 days. Every webhook has its own **Recent Deliveries** section, which lists whether a delivery was successful or failed at a glance. 

A webhook in dbt Cloud has a timeout of 10 seconds. This means that if the endpoint doesn't respond within 10 seconds, the webhook processor will time out. This can result in a situation where the client responds successfully after the 10 second timeout and records a success status while the dbt cloud webhooks system will interpret this as a failure.

## Prerequisites
- You have a dbt Cloud account that is on the [Team or Enterprise plan](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing/). 
- For `write` access to webhooks: 
    - **Enterprise plan accounts** &mdash; Permission sets are the same for both API service tokens and the dbt Cloud UI. You, or the API service token, must have the [Account Admin](/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions#account-admin), [Admin](/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions#admin), or [Developer](/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions#developer) permission set.  
    - **Team plan accounts** &mdash; For the dbt Cloud UI, you need to have a [Developer license](/docs/cloud/manage-access/self-service-permissions). For API service tokens, you must assign the service token to have the [Account Admin or Member](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/service-tokens#team-plans-using-service-account-tokens) permission set. 
- You have a multi-tenant or an AWS single-tenant deployment model in dbt Cloud. For more information, refer to [Tenancy](/docs/cloud/about-cloud/tenancy). 

## Create a webhook subscription {#create-a-webhook-subscription}

From your **Account Settings** in dbt Cloud (using the gear menu in the top right corner), click **Create New Webhook** in the **Webhooks** section. You can find the appropriate dbt Cloud access URL for your region and plan with [Regions & IP addresses](/docs/cloud/about-cloud/access-regions-ip-addresses).

To configure your new webhook: 

- **Name** &mdash; Enter a name for your outbound webhook.
- **Description** &mdash; Enter a description of the webhook.
- **Events** &mdash; Choose the event you want to trigger this webhook. You can subscribe to more than one event.
- **Jobs** &mdash; Specify the job(s) you want the webhook to trigger on. Or, you can leave this field empty for the webhook to trigger on all jobs in your account. By default, dbt Cloud configures your webhook at the account level. 
- **Endpoint** &mdash; Enter your application's endpoint URL, where dbt Cloud can send the event(s) to.

When done, click **Save**. dbt Cloud provides a secret token that you can use to [check for the authenticity of a webhook](#validate-a-webhook). It’s strongly recommended that you perform this check on your server to protect yourself from fake (spoofed) requests.

### Differences between completed and errored webhook events {#completed-errored-event-difference}
The `job.run.errored` event is a subset of the `job.run.completed` events. If you subscribe to both, you will receive two notifications when your job encounters an error. However, dbt Cloud triggers the two events at different times:

- `job.run.completed` &mdash;  This event only fires once the job’s metadata and artifacts have been ingested and are available from the dbt Cloud Admin and Discovery APIs. 
- `job.run.errored` &mdash; This event fires immediately so the job’s metadata and artifacts might not have been ingested. This means that information might not be available for you to use.

If your integration depends on data from the Admin API (such as accessing the logs from the run) or Discovery API (accessing model-by-model statuses), use the `job.run.completed` event and filter on `runStatus` or `runStatusCode`. 

If your integration doesn’t depend on additional data or if improved delivery performance is more important for you, use `job.run.errored` and build your integration to handle API calls that might not return data a short period at first. 


## Validate a webhook

You can use the secret token provided by dbt Cloud to validate that webhooks received by your endpoint were actually sent by dbt Cloud. Official webhooks will include the `Authorization` header that contains a SHA256 hash of the request body and uses the secret token as a key. 

An example for verifying the authenticity of the webhook in Python:

```python
auth_header = request.headers.get('authorization', None)
app_secret = os.environ['MY_DBT_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKEN'].encode('utf-8')
signature = hmac.new(app_secret, request_body, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
return signature == auth_header

```

## Inspect HTTP requests 
When working with webhooks, it’s good practice to use tools like [RequestBin](https://requestbin.com/) and [Requestly](https://requestly.io/). These tools allow you to inspect your HTML requests, response payloads, and response headers so you can debug and test webhooks before incorporating them into your systems. 

## Examples of JSON payloads

## API for webhooks {#api-for-webhooks}
You can use the dbt Cloud API to create new webhooks that you want to subscribe to, get detailed information about your webhooks, and to manage the webhooks that are associated with your account. The following sections describe the API endpoints you can use for this. 

:::info Access URLs
dbt Cloud is hosted in multiple regions in the world and each region has a different access URL. People on Enterprise plans can choose to have their account hosted in any one of these regions. For a complete list of available dbt Cloud access URLs, refer to [Regions & IP addresses](/docs/cloud/about-cloud/access-regions-ip-addresses).
