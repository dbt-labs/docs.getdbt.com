In general, the dbt Cloud application deployment models fall into two categories: **Multi Tenant** and **Single Tenant**. These deployments are hosted on infrastructure managed by dbt Labs. Both models leverage AWS infrastructure as described in the [Architecture](/docs/deploy/architecture) section.
