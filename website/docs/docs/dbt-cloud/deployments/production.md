The Production deployment environment refers to the multi-tenant SaaS dbt Cloud application hosted by Fishtown Analytics. This is the most commonly used deployment as it is completely managed and maintained by Fishtown Analytics. As a SaaS product, a user can quickly [create an account](https://www.getdbt.com/signup/) and get started using the product. The Production environment is hosted in AWS and contains the latest software updates and bug fixes.
