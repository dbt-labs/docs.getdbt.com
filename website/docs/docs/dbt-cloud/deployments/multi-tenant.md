The Multi Tenant (SaaS) deployment environment refers to the SaaS dbt Cloud application hosted by dbt Labs. This is the most commonly used deployment and is completely managed and maintained by dbt Labs, the makers of dbt. As a SaaS product, a user can quickly [create an account](https://www.getdbt.com/signup/) and get started using the product. The deployment is hosted in AWS and will always contain the latest software updates and bug fixes.

If your organization requires more advanced security, SSO/RBAC, or additional support, please contact dbt Labs sales (sales@dbtlabs.com) to learn more about our Enterprise plans.
