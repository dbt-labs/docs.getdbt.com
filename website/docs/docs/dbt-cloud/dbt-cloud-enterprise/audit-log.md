dbt Cloudâ€™s Audit Log allows you to quickly review the actions performed by members of your organization. It includes details such as who performed the action, what the action was, and when it was performed. These details can be used in various troubleshooting and security scenarios.

## Accessing the Audit Log

To access Audit Log, click **Account Settings** and **Audit Log**

## Exploring the Audit Log

Audit Log lists all the events that occurred in your organization within the last 90 days. Audit Log is only accessible by the Org Owner. Once you get to the Audit Log page, you will see a list of various events and their associated event data. Each of these events have the following information on the main UI:

1. **Event name** - Action that was triggered
2. **Agent** - User that triggered that action/event
3. **Timestamp** - Local timestamp of when the event occurred

### Detailed Event View

Clicking on the event card opens a detailed view of the event. This displays granular information about the event. This view can be helpful in identifying details about the event. For example, if the settings for a job were changed, you can use the detailed event view to understand which job was changed, by whom, and when. This detailed view has the following information:

| Name                 | Description                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |

| service              | Service that carried out the action           |
| source               | Source of the event - dbt Cloud UI or API     |
| v1.events.event_type | This key will be different for each event and will match the event_type. This data will include all the details about the object(s) that was changed. |

## Searching the Audit Log

Audit Log also supports search. Currently, search is limited to the events and actors that are listed in the section above. Audit Log successfully lists historical events spanning the last 90 days. To search, search for an actor or event in the search bar and narrow your results based on the time window.

## Exporting Logs

Audit Log also allows you to export historical audit results for security, compliance, and analysis purposes. You can export data for up to the last 90 days. Clicking on the Export CSV button downloads a CSV file of all the events that occurred in your org over the last two weeks.
