## **Exploring the Audit Log**

Audit Log lists all the events that occurred in your organization within the last 90 days. Audit Log is only accessible by the Org Owner. Once you get to the Audit Log page, you will see a list of various events and their associated event data. Each of these events have the following information on the main UI:

1. **Event name** - Action that was triggered
2. **Agent** - User that triggered that action/event
3. **Timestamp** - Local timestamp of when the event occurred

### **Detailed Event View**

Clicking on the event card opens a detailed view of the event. This displays granular information about the event. This view can be helpful in identifying details about the event. For example, if the settings for a job were changed, you can use the detailed event view to understand which job was changed, by whom, and when. This detailed view has the following information:
