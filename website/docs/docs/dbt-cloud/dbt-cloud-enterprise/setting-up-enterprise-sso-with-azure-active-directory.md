:::info Enterprise Feature
This guide describes a feature of the dbt Cloud Enterprise plan. If youâ€™re
interested in learning more about an Enterprise plan, contact us at
sales@getdbt.com.
:::

dbt Cloud Enterprise supports single-sign on via Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
You will need permissions to create and manage a new Azure AD application.
Currently supported features include:

* IdP-initiated SSO
* SP-initiated SSO
* Just-in-time provisioning

## Configuration

dbt Cloud supports both single tenant and multitenant Azure Active Directory SSO
Connections. For most Enterprise purposes, you will want to use the single
tenant flow when creating an Azure AD Application.

### Creating an application

Log into the Azure portal for your organization. Using the **Azure Active Directory** page, you will
need to select the appropriate directory and then register a new application.

1. Under **Manage**, select **App registrations**
2. Click **+ New Registration** to begin creating a new application
3. Supply configurations for the **Name** and **Supported account types**
   fields as shown in the table below.

| Field | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Name** | dbt Cloud |
| **Supported account types** | Accounts in this organizational directory only _(single tenant)_ |

4. Configure the **Redirect URI**. The table below shows the appropriate
   Redirect URI values for single-tenant and multi-tenant deployments. For most
   enterprise use-cases, you will want to use the single-tenant Redirect URI.

:::note VPC Deployment
If you are deploying dbt Cloud into a VPC, you should use the hostname where
the dbt Cloud application is deployed instead of `https://cloud.getdbt.com` in
the **Redirect URI** input.
:::

| Application Type | Redirect URI |
| ----- | ----- |
| Single-Tenant _(recommended)_ | `https://cloud.getdbt.com/complete/azure_single_tenant` |
| Multi-Tenant | `https://cloud.getdbt.com/complete/azure_multi_tenant` |

5. Save the App registration to continue setting up Azure AD SSO

<Lightbox collapsed="true" src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/dbt-cloud-enterprise/azure/azure-new-application-alternative.png" title="Configuring a new app registration"/>

**Configuration with the new Azure AD interface (optional)**

Depending on your Azure AD settings, your App Registration page might look
different than the screenshots shown above. If you are _not_ prompted to
configure a Redirect URI on the **New Registration** page, then follow steps 6
and 7 below after creating your App Registration. If you were able to set up
the Redirect URI in the steps above, then skip ahead to step 8.

6. After registering the new application without specifying a Redirect URI,
   navigate to the **Authentication** tab for the new application.

7. Click **+ Add platform** and enter a Redirect URI for your application. See
   step 4 above for more information on the correct Redirect URI value for your
   dbt Cloud application.

### Configuring permissions

8. Under **Manage**, click **API Permissions**
9. Click **+Add a permission** and add the permissions shown below

| API Name | Type | Permission |
| -------- | ---- | ---------- |
| Microsoft Graph | Delegated | `Directory.AccessAsUser.All` |
| Microsoft Graph | Delegated | `Directory.Read.All` |
| Microsoft Graph | Application | `Directory.Read.All` |
| Microsoft Graph | Delegated | `User.Read` |

10. Save these permissions, then click **Grant admin consent** to grant admin
   consent for this directory on behalf of all of your users.

### Creating a client secret

11. Under **Manage**, click **Certificates & secrets**
12. Click **+New client secret**
13. Name the client secret "dbt Cloud" (or similar) to identify the secret
14. Select **Never** as the expiration value for this secret
15. Click **Add** to finish creating the client secret
16. Record the generated client secret somewhere safe. Later in the setup process,
   we'll use this client secret in dbt Cloud to finish configuring the
   integration.

<Lightbox collapsed="true" src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/dbt-cloud-enterprise/azure/azure-secret-saved.png" title="Recording the client secret" />

### Collect client credentials

17. Navigate to the **Overview** page for the app registration
18. Note the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID** shown in
   this form and record them along with your client secret. We'll use these keys
   in the steps below to finish configuring the integration in dbt Cloud.

## Configuring dbt Cloud

To complete setup, follow the steps below in the dbt Cloud application.

### Enable Azure AD Native Auth (beta)

- For users accessing dbt Cloud at cloud.getdbt.com, contact your account manager to
  gain access to the Azure AD Native auth configuration UI
- For users accessing dbt Cloud deployed in a VPC, enable the `native_azure`
  feature flag in the dbt Cloud admin backend.

### Supplying credentials

19. Navigate to the **Enterprise &gt; Single Sign On** page under Account
Settings.
20. Click the **Edit** button and supply the following SSO details:

| Field | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Log&nbsp;in&nbsp;with** | Azure AD Single Tenant |
| **Client&nbspID** | Paste the **Application (client) ID** recorded in the steps above |
| **Client&nbsp;Secret** | Paste the **Client Secret** recorded in the steps above |
| **Tenant&nbsp;ID** | Paste the **Directory (tenant ID)** recorded in the steps above |
| **Domain** | Enter the domain name for your Azure directory (eg. `fishtownanalytics.com`). Only users with accounts in this directory with this primary domain will be able to log into the dbt Cloud application. Optionally, you may specify a CSV of domains which are _all_ authorized to access your dbt Cloud account (eg. `fishtownanalytics.com, fishtowndata.com`) |
| **Slug** | Enter your desired login slug. Users will be able to log into dbt Cloud by navigating to `https://cloud.getdbt.com/enterprise-login/<login-slug>`. Login slugs must be unique across all dbt Cloud accounts, so pick a slug that uniquely identifies your company. |

21. Click **Save** to complete setup for the Azure AD SSO integration. From
    here, you can navigate to the URL generated for your account's _slug_ to
    test logging in with Azure AD.

:::success Logging in
Users in your Azure AD account will now be able to log into the application
by navigating to the URL:

`https://cloud.getdbt.com/enterprise-login/<login-slug>`
