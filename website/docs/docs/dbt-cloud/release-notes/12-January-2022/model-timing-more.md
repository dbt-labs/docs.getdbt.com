#### New products and features

We started the new year with a gift! Multi-tenant Team and Enterprise accounts can now use the new [Model timing](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/cloud-model-timing-tab) tab in dbt Cloud. You can use this tab to further explore long-running models to see if they need refactoring or rescheduling.

#### Performance improvements and enhancements

* We added client-side naming validation for file or folder creation.
