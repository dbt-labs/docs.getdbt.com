GitLab is changing their treatment of [OAuth access tokens that don't expire](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/deprecations.html#oauth-tokens-without-expiration) on May 22. We updated our IDE logic to handle OAuth token expiration more gracefully. Now after 2 hours of consecutive IDE usage, the user will have to re-authenticate in GitLab. This additional security layer in the IDE is available only to the dbt Cloud enterprise tier.
