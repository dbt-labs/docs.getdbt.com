On May 22, GitLab changed how they treat [OAuth access tokens that don't expire](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/deprecations.html#oauth-tokens-without-expiration). We updated our IDE logic to handle OAuth token expiration more gracefully. Now, the first time your token expires after 2 hours of consecutive IDE usage, you will have to re-authenticate in GitLab to refresh your expired OAuth access token. If you authorize dbt Cloud during this re-authentication, then we will handle subsequent refreshes for you. 

This additional security layer in the IDE is available only to the dbt Cloud enterprise plan.
