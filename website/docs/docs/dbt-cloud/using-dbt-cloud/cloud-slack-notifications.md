Setting up Slack notifications in dbt Cloud will allow you to receive alerts in a chosen Slack channel when a job run succeeds, fails, or is cancelled.

**Note**: Currently, Slack notifications can only be configured by one user to one Slack channel. Additionally, you must be an admin of the Slack workspace in order to configure Slack notifications.

In general, there are two parts to setting up Slack notifications. The first involves setting up the dbt Cloud integration with Slack, while the second involves setting up the notifications themselves.

 - If you **haven't** set up the integration: Watch the entire video below!

 - If you **have** set up the integration: Feel free to skip ahead to 0:40 in the video.
