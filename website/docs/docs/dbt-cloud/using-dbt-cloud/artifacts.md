When running dbt jobs, dbt Cloud generates and saves *artifacts*. You can use these artifacts, like `manifest.json`, `catalog.json`, and `sources.json` to power different aspects of dbt Cloud, namely: [dbt Docs](documentation) and [source freshness reporting](cloud-snapshotting-source-freshness).

## Create dbt Cloud Artifacts

While running any job can produce artifacts, you should only associate one production job with a given project to produce the project's artifacts. You can designate this connection in the **Project details** page. To access this page, click the gear icon in the upper right, select **Account Settings**, select your project, and click **Edit** in the lower right. Under **Artifacts**, select the jobs you want to produce documentation and source freshness artifacts for.

If you don't see your job listed, you might need to edit the job and select **Run source freshness** and **Generate docs on run**.

When you add a production job to a project, dbt Cloud updates the content and provides links to the production documentation and source freshness artifacts it generated for that project. You can see these links by clicking **Deploy** in the upper left, selecting **Jobs**, and then selecting the production job. From the job page, you can select a specific run to see how artifacts were updated for that run only.

### Documentation

When set up, dbt Cloud updates the **Documentation** link in the upper left so it links to documentation for this job. This link always points to the latest version of the documentation for your account!

### Source Freshness

As with Documentation, configuring a job for the Source Freshness artifact setting also updates the Data Sources link under **Deploy**. The new link points to the latest Source Freshness report for the selected job.
