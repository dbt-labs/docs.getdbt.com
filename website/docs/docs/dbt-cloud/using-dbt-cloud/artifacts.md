## dbt Cloud Artifacts

When dbt Cloud runs dbt jobs, it generates and saves *artifacts*. These artifacts, like `manifest.json`, `catalog.json`, and `sources.json` are used to power different aspects of dbt Cloud, namely: [dbt Docs](documentation) and [source freshness reporting](cloud-snapshotting-source-freshness).

While every dbt Cloud job will produce artifacts, typically there is only one production job for a given project. If you select a production job on the Project Settings page, dbt Cloud will render links to the production Documentation and Source Freshness artifacts generated for that project in the nav sidebar.

### Documentation

Once a job has been selected from the Documentation drop-down menu in your project settings, dbt Cloud's left-hand navbar will update to include a link to documentation for this job. This link will always point to the latest version of the documentation for your account!

### Source Freshness

As with Documentation, configuring a job for the Source Freshness artifact setting will update dbt Cloud's left-hand navbar to include a link to the latest Source Freshness report for the selected job.
