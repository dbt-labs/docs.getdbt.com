### Overview

Setting up notifications in dbt Cloud will allow you to receive alerts via Email or a chosen Slack channel when a job run succeeds, fails, or is cancelled.

### Email

There are two options for setting up email notifications. As a **user**, you can set up email notifications for yourself under your Profile. As an **admin**, you can set up notifications on your team members' behalf.

* **As a user:** Navigate to your **Profile** (found in the top right-hand side of dbt Cloud) and select **Notifications**.
\
Next select **Edit** and select the type of Notification (Succeeds, Fails, or Is Cancelled) for each Job for which you would like to be notified.

* **As an admin:**  Navigate to Account Settings > Notifications.
Select the User you'd like to set notifications for. Select **Edit** and select the type of Notification (Succeeds, Fails, or Is Cancelled) for each Job for which they will be notified.

Finally press **Save**.

### Slack

**Note**: Currently, Slack notifications can only be configured by one user to one Slack channel. Additionally, you must be an admin of the Slack workspace in order to configure Slack notifications.

In general, there are two parts to setting up Slack notifications. The first involves setting up the dbt Cloud integration with Slack, while the second involves setting up the notifications themselves.
