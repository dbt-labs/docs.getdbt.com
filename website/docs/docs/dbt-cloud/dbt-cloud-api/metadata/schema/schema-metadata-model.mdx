import { ArgsTable, SchemaTable } from "./schema";

The model object allows you to query information about a particular model in a given job.

### Arguments

When querying for a `model`, the following arguments are available:

<ArgsTable queryName="model" />

Below we show some illustrative example queries and outline the schema (all possible fields you can query) of this model object.

### Example Queries
#### Finding parent models and sources

The example query below uses the `parentsModels` and `parentsSources` fields to fetch information about a modelâ€™s parent models and parent sources. Note that we put a placeholder jobID and uniqueID, which you will have to replace.

```graphql
{
  model(jobId: 123, uniqueId: "model.jaffle_shop.dim_user") {
    parentsModels {
      runId
      uniqueId
      executionTime
    }
    parentsSources {
      runId
      uniqueId
      state
    }
  }
}
```

#### Model Timing

The example query below could be useful if we wanted to understand information around execution timing on a given model (start, end, completion).

```graphql
{
  model(jobId: 123, uniqueId: "model.jaffle_shop.dim_user") {
    runId
    projectId
    name
    uniqueId
    resourceType
    executeStartedAt
    executeCompletedAt
    executionTime
  }
}
```

### Fields
When querying for a `model`, the following fields are available:

<SchemaTable nodeName="ModelNode" />
