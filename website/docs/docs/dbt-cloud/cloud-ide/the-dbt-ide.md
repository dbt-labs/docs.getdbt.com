:::info Prerequisites

To set up your account to use the IDE, consult the guide on [using the dbt IDE](using-the-dbt-ide).

:::


The dbt Integrated Development Environment (IDE) provides a realtime editing and execution environment for your dbt project. In the dbt IDE, you can write, run, test, and version control the code in your dbt project from your browser -- no command line use required.

## Compiling and Running SQL

In the dbt IDE, you can compile dbt code into SQL and execute it against your database directly. The IDE leverages the open-source [dbt server](rpc) to intelligently recompile only the parts of your project that have changed. This brings the cycle time for dbt project development down from minutes to seconds.

## Running Projects

In addition to compiling and executing SQL, you can also *run* dbt projects in the dbt IDE. Use dbt's [rich model selection syntax](node-selection/syntax) to [run dbt commands](dbt-commands) directly in your browser.

The dbt IDE updates in real-time as models, tests, seeds, and operations are run. If a model or tests fails, you can dig into the logs to find and fix the issue.

## Version Control

Leverage git directly from the dbt IDE to version control your code from your browser. You can branch, commit, push, and pull code with a couple of clicks - no command line required.
