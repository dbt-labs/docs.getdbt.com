## dbt Cloud v1.1.31 (July 21, 2021)
We’ve improved the tabbing experience in the IDE. Tabs now work much more intuitively, and you don’t have to worry about losing your work anymore!

#### New products and features
- We are working to release a DAG directly in the IDE, so that when you’re developing, you have a clear idea of where the model you’re working on sits in the dependency graph. If you’re interested in testing out the feature early, head over to the #beta-feedback-for-ide-dag, and we’ll get the new product feature-flagged on your account!
- Added dbt 0.20.0 to Cloud

#### Bug fixes
- Users will now be able to initialize any project that doesn't contain a `dbt_project.yml` file, regardless of whether or not there are pre-existing files and/or commits to that repo.

#### Performance improvements and enhancements
- We've been working on some nice improvements to tabs in our IDE. We’ve fixed deficiencies with tabs that caused users to lose work if they didn’t hit save regularly enough. Additionally, opening, closing, and the order of the tabs work much more smoothly.
- You may have noticed that there is now a source freshness checkbox in your execution settings when you configure a job on dbt Cloud. Selecting this checkbox will run dbt source snapshot-freshness as the first step in your job, but it will not break subsequent steps if it fails. Updated source freshness documentation available [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/cloud-snapshotting-source-freshness).
- Added a new endpoint to allow API key rotation via `POST https://cloud.getdbt.com/api/v2/users/{user-id}/apiKey`


## dbt Cloud v1.1.30 (July 7, 2021)
We shipped a resizable folder pane in the IDE, and we're hearing great things! "My quality of life has greatly increased with this little update!" Hope this helps everyone else enjoy the IDE a little more too.

#### New products and features
- Resizable folder pane in the IDE: Have you ever developed in the IDE and not been able to see the full name of your model because you couldn’t adjust the width of the file pane? Yeah, us too. Now you’ll be able to adjust your project’s file tree width to be as wide or as narrow as you’d like. It’s these small things that make developing in the IDE so much easier.

#### Bug fixes
- Made some changes to GitLab webhooks so that the status of the dbt run gets properly updated in GitLab.
- Resolved an issue where users saw a blank screen rather than the SSO reauthentication page.

#### Performance improvements and enhancements
- Refreshed the design of the repository import page.


## dbt Cloud v1.1.29 (June 23, 2021)
We're heads down working on a handful of new features that we're going to share at the end of this month. The finish line is in sight. In the meantime, check out our latest release candidates for dbt Core. The biggest changes are better tests, providing consistency, configurability, and persistence. Additionally, we've refactored partial parsing and introduced an experimental parser; both are set to off by default.

#### New products and features
- Add support for latest Core release candidates to dbt Cloud: v0.19.2-rc2 and v0.20.0-rc1

#### Bug fixes
- Add a safeguard for the SSO reauth page to avoid 401 interceptors

#### Performance improvements and enhancements
- Ensure navigation bar is in dark mode when IDE is set to dark mode


## dbt Cloud v1.1.28 (June 9, 2021)
We shipped a far better experience for GitLab users. Be sure to check out new CI features that are now available for customers using GitLab. Additionally, all developers should test out Slim CI which will speed up their model builds.

#### New products and features

- `Slim CI`: We’ve made Slim CI available for all our cloud customers! With Slim CI, you don't have to rebuild and test all your models; you can instruct dbt Cloud to run jobs on only modified or new resources. If you are a GitHub or GitLab user, try creating a new job that runs on pull requests and you can signal to dbt to run only on these modified resources by including the `state:modified+` argument. Read more about Slim CI [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/cloud-enabling-continuous-integration-with-github#slim-ci).

- Native GitLab authentication for dbt Cloud Developer and Team Tiers: We’ve shipped native GitLab auth into GA. You can now import new GitLab repos with a couple clicks, trigger CI builds when Merge Requests are opened in GitLab, and carry GitLab permissions through to dbt Cloud IDE's git actions. Read how to set up native GitLab auth [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/connecting-gitlab).

#### Bug fixes
- Allow users to select artifacts from a job that runs source freshness on jobs with the source freshness execution settings set to `ON`.
- Resolve `RUN ONLY ON CUSTOM BRANCH?` button to toggle on and off properly.
- Retain information in a `Statement` tab when the page is refreshed.
- Unsaved changes in the IDE are now saved when committing work.
- Drop temporary schemas in the data warehouse for closed or merged GitLab merge requests.

#### Performance improvements and enhancements
- Behind the scenes, we’ve been moving off of Angular and onto React. We’ve started the process of migrating the central pieces of our UI over - the first of which is the main navigation. We think this will have a big impact on our ability to reduce UI bugs and improve user experience.
- Added support for dbt 0.19.2rc2 + 0.20.0rc1 in dbt Cloud.
