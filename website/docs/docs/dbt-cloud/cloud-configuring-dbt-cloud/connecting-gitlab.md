## Overview

Connecting your GitLab account to dbt Cloud unlocks exciting and compelling functionality in dbt Cloud. Once your GitLab account is connected, you can:
- [Trigger CI builds](cloud-enabling-continuous-integration-with-github) when Merge Requests are opened in GitLab
- Import new repos with one click
- Carry GitLab permissions through to dbt Cloud IDE's git actions
## For Developer and Team tiers

To connect your personal GitLab account, navigate to your [Profile](https://cloud.getdbt.com/#/profile/) and select [Integrations](https://cloud.getdbt.com/#/profile/integrations/) from the left sidebar. 

If your account is not connected, click the button `Link your GitLab account` to continue the setup process.

You should be redirected to GitLab and prompted to sign into your account. GitLab will then ask for your explicit authorization: 

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/connecting-gitlab/GitLab-Auth.png" title="GitLab Authorization Screen" />

Once you've accepted, you should be redirected back to dbt Cloud, and you'll see that your account has been linked.

Now that you've linked to your account from your Profile page, you should verify that you see your deploy token in your Project Settings page. 

## For Enterprise tier

Before developers can personally authenticate in GitLab, account admins need to set up a GitLab application.

Account admins should navigate to `Account Settings` and click on the `Integrations` tab.

Admins can create a Group Owned Application in GitLab - [GitLab has a guide for that here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html#group-owned-applications). 

In GitLab, when creating your Group Owned Application, input the following:
- `Name` - We recommend `dbt Cloud`
- `Redirect URI` - You should copy-paste this from your Account Integrations page in dbt Cloud, but it is likely `https://cloud.getdbt.com/complete/gitlab`
- Check the `Confidential` box
- Check the `api` Scope

The application form in GitLab should look like this:

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/connecting-gitlab/GitLab-Group-App.png" title="GitLab group owned applications set up"/>

Click `Save application` in GitLab, and GitLab will then generate an Application ID and Secret. You can copy-paste those values back into the form on your dbt Cloud's Integrations page.

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/gitlab_integration_edit_button.png" title="Edit button in the top right corner"/>

Note that if you're using the regular consumer version of GitLab, you'll want to use the standard `https://gitlab.com` for your GitLab instance - if your organization is using a hosted version of GitLab, you'll want to use the hostname provided by your organization: `https://gitlab.yourgreatcompany.com/`.

Once the form is complete in dbt Cloud, click the button `Connect to GitLab`.

GitLab will then ask for your explicit authorization: 

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/connecting-gitlab/GitLab-Auth.png" title="GitLab Authorization Screen" />

And you're all set!

Non-admins on Enterprise accounts can authenticate by going to `Profile` and then `Integrations` and clicking the `Link your GitLab account` button.

## Troubleshooting

### Errors importing a repository
If you do not see your repository listed, double-check that:
- Your repository is in a Gitlab group you have access to. dbt Cloud will not read repos associated with a user.

If you do see your repository listed but are unable to import the repository successfully, double-check that:
- You are a maintainer on that repository (only users with maintainer permissions can set up repository connections)
