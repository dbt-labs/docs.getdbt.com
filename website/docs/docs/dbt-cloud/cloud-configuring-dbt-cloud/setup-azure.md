## Overview

To use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for identity and access management in dbt Cloud, an account admin needs to set up an Azure AD app:

1. [Register an Azure AD app](#register-an-azure-ad-app) in Azure DevOps.
2. [Add permissions to your new app](#add-permissions-to-your-new-app).
3. [Connect Azure DevOps to your new app](#connect-azure-devops-to-your-new-app).
4. [Add your Azure AD app to dbt Cloud](#add-your-azure-ad-app-to-dbt-cloud).

Once the Azure AD app is set up and added to dbt Cloud, then dbt Cloud developers can personally authenticate in dbt Cloud from Azure DevOps. For more on this, see [Authenitcate with Azure DevOps](docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/authenticate-azure).

## Register an Azure AD app

1. Sign into you Azure DevOps account and click **Azure AD**.
2. Select **App registrations** in the left panel.
3. Select **New registration**. The form for creating a new Active Directory app opens.
4. Provide a name for your app. We recommend using, "dbt Labs Azure DevOps App".
5. Select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant)** as the Supported Account Types.
6. Add a redirect URI by selecting **Web** and typing in `https://cloud.getdbt.com/complete/azure_active_directory`. If you have a custom dbt Cloud URL be sure to use the appropriate domain.
7. Click **Register**.

Here's what your app should look before registering it:

1. Select **API permissions** in the left navigation panel.
2. Remove the "Microsoft Graph / User Read" permission.
3. Click **Add a permission**.
4. Select **Azure DevOps**.
5. Select the **user_impersonation** permission.

## Connect Azure DevOps to your new app

Connect Azure DevOps to the Active Directory App you just created:

1. From your Azure DevOps account, select **Organization settings** in the bottom left.
2. Navigate to Azure Active Directory.
3. Click **Connect directory**.
4. Select the directory you want to connect.
5. Click **Connect**.

## Add your Azure AD app to dbt Cloud

Once you connect Azure AD app and Azure DevOps, you need to provide dbt Cloud information about the app:

1. Navigate to your account settings in dbt Cloud.
2. Select **Integrations**.
3. Scroll to the Azure DevOps section.
4. Complete the form:
    - **Azure DevOps Organization:** Must match the name of your Azure DevOps organization exactly.
    - **Application (client) ID:** Found in the Azure AD App.
    - **Client secrets:** Need to first create in the Azure AD App under "Client credentials." You are responsible for the Azure AD app secret expiration and rotation.
    - **Directory(tenant) ID:** Found in the Azure AD App.

Your Azure AD app should now be added to your dbt Cloud Account. People on your team who want to develop in dbt Cloud's IDE can now personally [authorize Azure DevOps from their profiles](dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/authenticate-azure).
