## Overview

Connecting your GitHub account to dbt Cloud provides convenience and another layer of security to dbt Cloud:
- Log into dbt Cloud via OAuth through GitHub.
- Import new GitHub repos with a couple clicks during dbt Cloud project setup.
- Clone repos using HTTPS rather than SSH.
- Trigger [Continuous integration](cloud-enabling-continuous-integration-with-github) builds when pull requests are opened in GitHub.


To connect GitHub in dbt Cloud:
1. A GitHub organization owner must first [install the dbt Cloud application](/cloud-installing-the-github-application#installing-dbt-cloud-in-your-github-account) in your team's GitHub account.
2. All other dbt Cloud developers on the account need to [personally authenticate with GitHub](/cloud-installing-the-github-application#personally-authenticate-with-github) from dbt Cloud.

If you are the GitHub organization owner tasked with the installation of the dbt Cloud app in step 1, you will also be automatically personally authenticated after completion, so step 2 will be taken care of. This means teams of one only need to complete step 1.

:::info Use GitHub On-Premise?
If you're using an On-Premise GitHub deployment, this method will not work for your account. Please instead reference our 
docs on [importing a project by git URL](docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/cloud-import-a-project-by-git-url#github) to set up your connection. This alternative connection method does not include the benefits of the native integration mentioned above.

## Installing dbt Cloud in your GitHub account

A GitHub organization owner needs to connect and configure the dbt Cloud app for their GitHub organization. If you are a team of one or wish to connect your personal GitHub account, then these instructions also apply to you.

To link your dbt Cloud account to your team's GitHub account, navigate to Your Profile settings by clicking the gear icon in the top right. Select **Linked Accounts** in the left menu.

In the Linked Accounts section, you can set up your GitHub account connection to dbt Cloud by clicking **Link** to the right of GitHub. This redirects you to your account on GitHub where you will be asked to install and configure the dbt Cloud application. Select the GitHub organization and repositories dbt Cloud should access.

The dbt Cloud GitHub App requires the following permissions:
- Read access to metadata
- Read and write access to checks, code, commit statuses, pull requests, and workflows

Once you grant access to the app, you will be redirected back to dbt Cloud and shown a linked account success state. You are now personally authenticated too, and your team members can begin [connecting their profiles](/cloud-installing-the-github-application#personally-authenticate-with-github).

## Configuring the dbt Cloud app in your GitHub account
If you are your GitHub organization owner, you can also configure the dbt Cloud GitHub application to have access to only select repositories. This configuration must be done in GitHub, but we provide an easy link to start the process in dbt Cloud.

## Personally authenticate with GitHub
dbt Cloud developers on the Enterprise plan must each connect their GitHub profiles to dbt Cloud, as every developer's read / write access for the dbt repo is checked in the dbt Cloud IDE. dbt Cloud developers on the Team plan do not need to each connect their profiles to GitHub, but it is still recommended to do so. 

To connect your personal GitHub account, dbt Cloud developers should navigate to their settings and scroll to **Linked Accounts** under **Your Profile**.

If your GitHub account is not connected, you’ll see "No connected account". Select **Link** to begin the setup process. You’ll be redirected to GitHub, and asked to authorize dbt Cloud in a grant screen.
<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/connecting-github/github-auth.png" title="Authorizing the dbt Cloud app for developers"/>

Once you approve authorization, you will be redirected to dbt Cloud, and you should now see your connected account. The next time you log into dbt Cloud, you will be able to do so via OAuth through GitHub, and if you're on the Enterprise plan, you're ready to use the dbt Cloud IDE.
