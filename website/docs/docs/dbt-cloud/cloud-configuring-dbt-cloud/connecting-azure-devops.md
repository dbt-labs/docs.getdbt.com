## About Azure DevOps and dbt Cloud

You can connect your Azure DevOps account in dbt Cloud to unlock new product experiences such as the ability to:

- Import new Azure DevOps repos with a couple clicks during dbt Cloud project setup.
- Clone repos using HTTPS rather than SSH
- Enforce user authorization with OAuth 2.0.
- Carry Azure DevOps user repository permissions (read / write access) through to dbt Cloud IDE's git actions.
- Trigger Continuous integration (CI) builds when pull requests are opened in Azure DevOps.

To connect Azure DevOps in dbt Cloud:

1. An account admin needs to [set up an Active Directory application and add it to dbt Cloud](docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/setup-azure).
2. dbt Cloud developers need to [personally authenticate with Azure DevOps](docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/authenticate-azure) from dbt Cloud.
