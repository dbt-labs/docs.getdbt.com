Develop dbt projects using dbt Cloud, which offers a fast and reliable way to work on your dbt project. It runs dbt Core in a hosted (single or multi-tenant) environment.

You can develop in your browser using an integrated development environment (IDE) or in a dbt Cloud-powered command line interface (CLI).
