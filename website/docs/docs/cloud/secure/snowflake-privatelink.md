The following steps will walk you through the setup of a Snowflake AWS PrivateLink endpoint in the dbt Cloud multi-tenant environment.

:::note Snowflake SSO with PrivateLink
Users connecting to Snowflake using SSO over a PrivateLink connection from dbt Cloud will also require access to a PrivateLink endpoint from their local workstation.

>Currently, for any given Snowflake account, SSO works with only one account URL at a time: either the public account URL or the URL associated with the private connectivity service.

- [Snowflake SSO with Private Connectivity](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-security-fed-auth-overview#label-sso-private-connectivity)

## Configure PrivateLink

1. Open a Support case with Snowflake to allow access from the dbt Cloud AWS account
- Snowflake prefers that the account owner opens the Support case directly, rather than dbt Labs acting on their behalf. For more information, refer to [Snowflake's knowledge base article](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/HowtosetupPrivatelinktoSnowflakefromCloudServiceVendors)
- Provide them with your dbt Cloud account ID along with any other information requested in the article.
  - AWS account ID: `346425330055` - _NOTE: This account ID only applies to dbt Cloud Multi-Tenant environments. For Virtual Private/Single-Tenant account IDs please contact [Support](https://docs.getdbt.com/community/resources/getting-help#dbt-cloud-support)._
- You will need to have `ACCOUNTADMIN` access to the Snowflake instance to submit a Support request.

2. After Snowflake has granted the requested access, run the Snowflake system function [SYSTEM$GET_PRIVATELINK_CONFIG](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/system_get_privatelink_config.html) and copy the output.

3. Add the required information to the template below, and submit your request to  [dbt Support](https://docs.getdbt.com/community/resources/getting-help#dbt-cloud-support):

```
Subject: New Multi-Tenant PrivateLink Request
- Type: Snowflake
- SYSTEM$GET_PRIVATELINK_CONFIG output:
- *Use privatelink-account-url or regionless-privatelink-account-url?: 
- dbt Cloud multi-tenant environment (US, EMEA, AU):
```
_*By default dbt Cloud will be configured to use `privatelink-account-url` from the provided [SYSTEM$GET_PRIVATELINK_CONFIG](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/system_get_privatelink_config.html) as the PrivateLink endpoint. Upon request, `regionless-privatelink-account-url` can be used instead._

## Create Connection in dbt Cloud

Once dbt Cloud support completes the configuration, you can start creating new connections using PrivateLink. 

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Create new project** → select **Snowflake**. 
2. You will see two radio buttons: **Public** and **Private.** Select **Private**. 
3. Select the private endpoint from the dropdown (this will automatically populate the hostname/account field).
4. Configure the remaining data platform details.
5. Test your connection and save it.
