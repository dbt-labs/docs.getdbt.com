dbt Cloud Enterprise supports Single-Sign On (SSO) via Google GSuite. You will need
permissions to create and manage a new Google OAuth2 application, as well as
access to enable the Google Admin SDK. Gsuite is a component within Google
Cloud Platform (GCP), so you will also need access to a login with permissions
to manage the GSuite application within a GCP account.

Some customers choose to use different cloud providers for User and Group permission setup
than for hosting infrastructure. For example, it's certainly possible to use GSuite to
manage login information and Multifactor Authentication (MFA) configuration while hosting
data workloads on AWS.

 Currently supported features include:

* SP-initiated SSO
* Just-in-time provisioning

This guide outlines the setup process for authenticating to dbt Cloud with
Google GSuite.

## Configuration of the GSuite organization within GCP

dbt Cloud uses a Client ID and Client Secret to authenticate users of a
GSuite organization. The steps below outline how to create a Client ID and
Client Secret for use in dbt Cloud.

### Creating credentials

1. Navigate to the GCP [API Manager](https://console.developers.google.com/projectselector/apis/credentials)
2. Select an existing project, or create a new project for your API Credentials
3. Click on **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth Client ID** in the resulting
   popup
4. Google requires that you configure an OAuth consent screen for OAuth
   credentials. Click the **Configure consent screen** button to create
   a new consent screen if prompted.
5. On the OAuth consent screen page, configure the following settings ([Google docs](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en#userconsent)):

| Configuration          | Value        | notes |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ------ |
| **Application type**   | internal     | required |
| **Application name**   | dbt Cloud    | required |
| **Application logo**   | Download the logo <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/ui/img/dbt-icon.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> | optional |
| **Authorized domains** | `getdbt.com` | If deploying into a VPC, use the domain for your deployment |
| **Scopes** | `email, profile, openid` | The default scopes are sufficient |

6. Save the **Consent screen** settings to navigate back to the **Create OAuth client
   id** page.
7. Use the following configuration values when creating your Credentials, replacing `YOUR_ACCESS_URL` and `YOUR_AUTH0_URI`,Â which need to be replaced with the [appropriate Access URL and Auth0 URI](/docs/cloud/manage-access/sso-overview#auth0-multi-tenant-uris) for your region and plan.

| Config | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| **Application type** | Web application |
| **Name** | dbt Cloud |
| **Authorized Javascript origins** | `https://YOUR_ACCESS_URL` |
| **Authorized Redirect URIs** | `https://YOUR_AUTH0_URI/login/callback` |

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/dbt-cloud-enterprise/gsuite/gsuite-sso-credentials.png" title="GSuite Credentials configuration"/>

8. Press "Create" to create your new credentials. A popup will appear
with a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Write these down as you will need them later!

### Enabling the Admin SDK

dbt Cloud requires that the Admin SDK is enabled in this application to request
Group Membership information from the GSuite API. To enable the Admin SDK for
this project, navigate to the [Admin SDK Settings page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/admin.googleapis.com/overview)
and ensure that the API is enabled.

## Configuration in dbt Cloud

To complete setup, follow the steps below in the dbt Cloud application.

### Supply your OAuth Client ID and Client Secret

1. Navigate to the **Enterprise &gt; Single Sign On** page under Account
Settings.
2. Click the **Edit** button and supply the following SSO details:
    - **Log in with**: GSuite
    - **Client ID**: Paste the Client ID generated in the steps above
    - **Client Secret**: Paste the Client Secret generated in the steps above
    - **Domain in GSuite**: Enter the domain name for your GSuite account (eg. `dbtlabs.com`).
      Only users with an email address from this domain will be able to log into your dbt Cloud
      account using GSuite auth. Optionally, you may specify a CSV of domains
      which are _all_ authorized to access your dbt Cloud account (eg. `dbtlabs.com, fishtowndata.com`)
    - **Slug**: Enter your desired login slug. Users will be able to log into dbt
      Cloud by navigating to `https://YOUR_ACCESS_URL/enterprise-login/LOGIN-SLUG`, replacing `YOUR_ACCESS_URL` with the [appropriate Access URL](/docs/cloud/about-cloud/regions-ip-addresses) for your region and plan. The `LOGIN-SLUG` must
      be unique across all dbt Cloud accounts, so pick a slug that uniquely
      identifies your company.
    <Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/dbt-cloud-enterprise/gsuite/gsuite-sso-cloud-config.png" title="GSuite SSO Configuration"/>
3. Click **Save &amp; Authorize** to authorize your credentials. You should be
   dropped into the GSuite OAuth flow and prompted to log into dbt Cloud with
   your work email address. If authentication is successful, you will be
   redirected back to the dbt Cloud application.
4. On the **Credentials** page, verify that a `groups` entry is
   present, and that it reflects the groups you are a member of in GSuite. If
   you do not see a `groups` entry in the IdP attribute list, consult the following
   Troubleshooting steps.

    <Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/dbt-cloud-enterprise/gsuite/gsuite-sso-cloud-verify.png" title="GSuite verify groups"/>

If the verification information looks appropriate, then you have completed the configuration of GSuite SSO.

## Setting up RBAC
Now you have completed setting up SSO with GSuite, the next steps will be to set up
[RBAC groups](/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions) to complete your access control configuration.

## Troubleshooting


### Invalid client error

If you experience an `Error 401: invalid_client` when authorizing with GSuite, double check that:
 - The Client ID provided matches the value generated in the GCP API Credentials page.
 - Ensure the Domain Name(s) provided matches the one(s) for your GSuite account.

### OAuth errors

If OAuth verification does not complete successfully, double check that:
 - The Admin SDK is enabled in your GCP project
 - The Client ID and Client Secret provided match the values generated in the
   GCP Credentials page
 - An Authorized Domain was provided in the OAuth Consent Screen configuration
If authentication with the GSuite API succeeds but you do not see a
`groups` entry on the **Credentials** page, then you may not have
permissions to access Groups in your GSuite account. Either request that your
GSuite user is granted the ability to request groups from an administrator, or
have an administrator log into dbt Cloud and authorize the GSuite integration.
