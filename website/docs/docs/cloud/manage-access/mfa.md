dbt Cloud provides multiple options for multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA provides an additional layer of security on top of username and password. The available MFA methods are:
- SMS verification code
- Authenticator app
- Webauthn-compliant security key

## Configuration

You can only have one of the three MFA methods configured per user. These are enabled at the user level, not the account level.

1. Navigate to the **Account settings** and under **Your profile** click on **Password & Security**. Click **Enroll** next to the preferred method.
