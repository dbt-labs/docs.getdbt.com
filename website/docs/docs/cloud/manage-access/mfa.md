# Multi-factor authentication

dbt Cloud provides multiple options for multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA provides an additional layer of security to username and password logins for Developer and Team plan accounts. The available MFA methods are:

- SMS verification code (US-based phone numbers only)
- Authenticator app
- Webauthn-compliant security key

This is available across dbt Cloud plans for users with username and password logins only. 

## Configuration

You can only have one of the three MFA methods configured per user. These are enabled at the user level, not the account level.

1. Navigate to the **Account settings** and under **Your profile** click on **Password & Security**. Click **Enroll** next to the preferred method.

4. You will be given a backup passcode, store it in a secure location. This key will be useful if the MFA method fails (like a lost or broken phone).

## Account Recovery

When setting up MFA, ensure that you store your recovery codes in a secure location, in case your MFA method fails. If you are unable to access your account, reach out to [support@getdbt.com](mailto:support@getdbt.com) for further support. You may need to create a new account if your account cannot be recovered. 

If possible, it's recommended to configure multiple MFA methods so that if one fails, there is a backup option.
