---

dbt Labs is partnering with Auth0 to bring enhanced features to dbt Cloud's single sign-on (SSO) capabilities. Auth0 is an identity and access management (IAM) platform with advanced security features, and it will be leveraged by dbt Cloud. These changes will require some action from customers with SSO configured in dbt Cloud today, and this guide will outline the necessary changes for each environment. 

If you have not yet configured SSO in dbt Cloud, refer instead to our setup guides for [SAML](docs/cloud/manage-access/set-up-sso-saml-2.0), [Okta](docs/cloud/manage-access/set-up-sso-okta), [Google Workspace](docs/cloud/manage-access/set-up-sso-google-workspace), or [Azure Active Directory](docs/cloud/manage-access/set-up-sso-azure-active-directory) single sign-on services.

## SAML 2.0 and Okta

SAML 2.0 users must update a few fields in the SSO app configuration to match the new Auth0 URL and URI.  You can approach this by editing the existing SSO app settings or creating a new one to accommodate the Auth0 settings. One approach isn't inherently better, so choose whichever works best for your organization.

The fields that will be updated are:
- Single sign-on URL &mdash; `https://<YOUR_AUTH0_URI>/login/callback?connection={slug}`
- Audience URI (SP Entity ID) &mdash; `urn:auth0:<YOUR_AUTH0_ENTITYID>:{slug}`

Replace {slug} with your organizationâ€™s login slug. It must be unique across all dbt Cloud instances and is usually something like your company name separated by dashes (for example, `dbt-labs`).

Here is an example of an updated SAML 2.0 setup in Okta.

After the configuration is saved, your SAML settings should look something like this:

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/access-control/new-okta-completed.png" title="New Okta configuration completed"/>

Once you have saved this information in the SSO environment, you must edit some information in the dbt Cloud settings. Navigate to the **Account Settings**, update the single sign-on URL fields, and provide the updated x.509 certificate.

Make sure to enable the "Use Auth0" option to ensure that the traffic is routed correctly. _The Auth0 migration action is final and cannot be undone_

Save the settings and test the new configuration using the SSO login URL provided on the settings page. 

## Google Workspace

Google Workspace admins updating their SSO APIs with the Auth0 URL won't have to do much if it is an existing setup. This can be done as a new project or by editing an existing SSO setup. No additional scopes are needed since this is migrating from an existing setup. All scopes were defined during the initial configuration. 

Steps to update:

1. Open the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and select the project with your dbt Cloud single sign-on settings. From the project page **Quick Access**, select **APIs and Services**

2. Click **Credentials** from the left side pane and click the appropriate name from **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs**

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/access-control/sso-project.png" title="Select the OAuth 2.0 Client ID"/>

3. In the **Client ID for Web application** window, find the **Authorized Redirect URIs** field and click **Add URI** and enter `https://<YOUR_AUTH0_URI>/login/callback`.

Click **Save** once you are done.

4. _You will need a person with Google Workspace admin privileges to complete these steps in dbt Cloud_. In dbt Cloud, navigate to the **Account Settings**, click on **Single Sign-on**, and then click **Edit** on the right side of the SSO pane. Enable the **Use Auth0** option and select **Save**. This will trigger an authorization window from Google that will require admin credentials. _The Auth0 migration action is final and cannot be undone_. Once the authentication has gone through, test the new configuration using the SSO login URL provided on the settings page.

## Azure Active Directory

Azure Active Directory admins will need to make a slight adjustment to the existing authentication app in the Azure AD portal. This migration does not require that the entire app be deleted or recreated; you can edit the existing app. Start by opening the Azure portal and navigating to the Active Directory overview.

1. Click **App Regitstrations** on the left side menu. 

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/access-control/aad-app-registration.png" title="Select App Registrations"/>

2. Select the proper **dbt Cloud** app (name may vary) from the list. From the app overview, click on the hyperlink next to **Redirect URI**

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/access-control/app-overview.png" title="Click the Redirect URI hyperlink"/>

3. In the **Web** pane with **Redirect URIs**, click **Add URI** and enter the appropriate `https://<YOUR_AUTH0_URI>/login/callback`. Save the settings and verify it is counted in the updated app overview.

4. Navigate to the dbt Cloud environment and open the **Account Settings**. Click the **Single Sign-on** option from the left side menu and click the **Edit** option from the right side of the SSO pane. Select the **Enable Auth0** option and **Save**. _Once this option is enabled, it cannot be undone._
