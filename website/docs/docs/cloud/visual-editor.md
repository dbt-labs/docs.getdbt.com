# About the visual editor <Lifecycle status='beta'/> 

<p style={{ color: '#717d7d', fontSize: '1.1em' }}>
The dbt Cloud visual editor helps analysts quickly create, edit, and visualize dbt models through a visual, drag-and-drop experience and with a built-in AI for custom code generation.
</p>

:::tip Beta feature
The visual editor in dbt Cloud provides users with a seamless and visual, drag-and-drop experience inside dbt Cloud. It's available in private beta for [dbt Cloud Enterprise accounts](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing). 

To join the private beta, [register your interest](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPjRGyrtgfmdY919Pf3kgqI5E95xxPXz-8JoVruw-L9jVtxg/viewform) or reach out to your account team to begin this process.
:::

The visual editor allows organizations to enjoy the many benefits of code-driven developmentâ€”such as increased precision, ease of debugging, and ease of validation &mdash; while retaining the flexibility to have different contributors develop wherever they are most comfortable. Users can also take advantage of built-in AI for custom code generation, making it an end-to-end frictionless experience.

These models compile directly to SQL and are indistinguishable from other dbt models in your projects:
- Visual models are version-controlled in your backing Git provider.
- All models are accessible across projects in [dbt Mesh](/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-1-intro).
- Models can be materialized into production through [dbt Cloud orchestration](/docs/deploy/deployments), or be built directly into a user's development schema.
- Integrate with [dbt Explorer](/docs/collaborate/explore-projects) and the [dbt Cloud IDE](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud).
