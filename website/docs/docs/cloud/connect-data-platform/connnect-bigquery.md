## Authentication

### JSON keyfile

:::info Uploading a service account JSON keyfile

While the fields in a BigQuery connection can be specified manually, we recommend uploading a service account <Term id="json" /> keyfile to quickly and accurately configure a connection to BigQuery.

:::

Uploading a JSON keyfile should populate the following fields:
- Project id
- Private key id
- Private key
- Client email
- Client id
- Auth uri
- Token uri
- Auth provider x509 cert url
- Client x509 cert url

In addition to these fields, there are two other optional fields that can be configured in a BigQuery connection:

| Field | Description | Examples |
| ----- | ----------- | ------- |
| Timeout | Deprecated; exists for backwards compatibility with older versions of dbt and will be removed in the future. | `300` |
| Location | The [location](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations) where dbt should create datasets. | `US`, `EU` |

### BigQuery OAuth
**Available in:** Development environments, Enterprise plans only

The OAuth auth method permits dbt Cloud to run development queries on behalf of
a BigQuery user without the configuration of BigQuery service account keyfile in dbt Cloud. For
more information on the initial configuration of a BigQuery OAuth connection in dbt Cloud, please see
[the docs on setting up BigQuery OAuth](/docs/cloud/manage-access/set-up-bigquery-oauth).

As an end user, if your organization has set up BigQuery OAuth, you can link a project with your personal BigQuery account in your personal Profile in dbt Cloud, like so:

## Configuration

To learn how to optimize performance with data platform-specific configurations in dbt Cloud, refer to [BigQuery-specific configuration](/reference/resource-configs/bigquery-configs).

### Optional configurations

In BigQuery, optional configurations let you tailor settings for tasks such as query priority, dataset location, job timeout, and more. These options give you greater control over how BigQuery functions behind the scenes to meet your requirements.

To customize your optional configurations in dbt Cloud:

- Click **Account home** from the left-hand side bar menu in dbt Cloud
- From there, click **Project** and select your BigQuery project
- Select your BigQuery project from the left-hand menu
- Click **Settings** towards the top right and a **Project details** window will open
- Scroll down to **Development Connection** and select BigQuery
- Click **Edit** and then scroll down to **Optional settings**

<Lightbox src="/img/bigquery/bigquery-optional-config.png" width="70%" title="BigQuery optional configuration"/>

The following are the optional configs you can set in dbt Cloud:

#### Priority

The `priority` for the BigQuery jobs that dbt executes can be configured with the `priority` configuration in your BigQuery profile. The priority field can be set to one of `batch` or `interactive`. For more information on query priority, consult the [BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/running-queries).

#### Retries

Retries in BigQuery help to ensure that jobs complete successfully by trying again after temporary failures, making your operations more robust and reliable.

#### Location

The `location` of BigQuery datasets can be set using the `location` setting in a BigQuery profile. As per the [BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations), `location` may be either a multi-regional location (for example, `EU`, `US`), or a regional location (like `us-west2`).







#### Maximum bytes build

When a `maximum_bytes_billed` value is configured for a BigQuery profile, that allows you to limit how much data your query can process. It’s a safeguard to prevent your query from accidentally processing more data than you expect, which could lead to higher costs. Queries executed by dbt will fail if they exceed the configured maximum bytes threshhold. This configuration should be supplied as an integer number of bytes.


  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: bigquery
      method: oauth
      project: abc-123
      dataset: my_dataset
      # If a query would bill more than a gigabyte of data, then
      # BigQuery will reject the query
      maximum_bytes_billed: 1000000000

```

Example output:

```

Database Error in model debug_table (models/debug_table.sql)
  Query exceeded limit for bytes billed: 1000000000. 2000000000 or higher required.
  compiled SQL at target/run/bq_project/models/debug_table.sql

```

#### Execution project

By default, dbt will use the specified `project`/`database` as both:

1. The location to materialize resources (models, seeds, snapshots, etc), unless they specify a custom project/database config
2. The GCP project that receives the bill for query costs or slot usage

Optionally, you may specify an execution_project to bill for query execution, instead of the project/database where you materialize most resources.

#### Impersonate service account

This feature allows users authenticating via local OAuth to access BigQuery resources based on the permissions of a service account.

For a general overview of this process, see the official docs for [Creating Short-lived Service Account Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/create-short-lived-credentials-direct).

#### Job retry deadline seconds

Job retry deadline seconds is the maximum amount of time BigQuery will spend retrying a job before it gives up.

#### Job creation timeout seconds

Job creation timeout seconds is the maximum time BigQuery will wait to start the job. If the job doesn’t start within that time, it times out.

#### Google cloud storage bucket

Everything you store in Cloud Storage must be placed inside a [bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/buckets). Buckets help you organize your data and manage access to it.

#### Dataproc region

A designated location in the cloud where you can run your data processing jobs efficiently. This region must match the location of your BigQuery dataset if you want to use Dataproc with BigQuery to ensure data doesn't move across regions, which can be inefficient and costly.

For more information on [dataproc regions](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations), refer to the BigQuery documentation.

#### Dataproc cluster name

A unique label you give to your group of virtual machines to help you identify and manage your data processing tasks in the cloud. When you integrate Dataproc with BigQuery, you need to provide the cluster name so BigQuery knows which specific set of resources (the cluster) to use for running the data jobs.

Have a look at [Dataproc's document on Create a cluster](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/guides/create-cluster) for an overview on how clusters work.

### Account level connections and credential management

You can re-use connections across multiple projects with [global connections](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/about-connections#migration-from-project-level-connections-to-account-level-connections). Connections are attached at the environment level (formerly project level), so you can utilize multiple connections inside of a single project (to handle dev, staging, production, etc.).

BigQuery connections in dbt Cloud currently expect the credentials to be handled at the connection level (and only BigQuery connections). This was originally designed to facilitate creating a new connection by uploading a service account keyfile. This describes how to override credentials at the environment level, via [extended attributes](/docs/dbt-cloud-environments#extended-attributes), _to allow project administrators to manage credentials independently_ of the account level connection details used for that environment.

For a project, you will first create an environment variable to store the secret `private_key` value. Then, you will use extended attributes to override the entire service account JSON (you can't only override the secret key due to a constraint of extended attributes).

1. **New environment variable**

    - Create a new _secret_ [environment variable](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/environment-variables#handling-secrets) to handle the private key: `DBT_ENV_SECRET_PROJECTXXX_PRIVATE_KEY`
    - Fill in the private key value according the environment

    To automate your deployment, use the following [admin API request](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cloud/api-v3#/operations/Create%20Projects%20Environment%20Variables%20Bulk), with `XXXXX` your account number, `YYYYY` your project number, `ZZZZZ` your [API token](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/authentication):

    ```shell
    curl --request POST \
    --url https://cloud.getdbt.com/api/v3/accounts/XXXXX/projects/YYYYY/environment-variables/bulk/ \
    --header 'Accept: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer ZZZZZ' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
    "env_var": [
    {
        "new_name": "DBT_ENV_SECRET_PROJECTXXX_PRIVATE_KEY",
        "project": "Value by default for the entire project",
        "ENVIRONMENT_NAME_1": "Optional, if wanted, value for environment name 1",
        "ENVIRONMENT_NAME_2": "Optional, if wanted, value for environment name 2"
    }
    ]
    }'
    ```

2. **Extended attributes**

    In the environment details, complete the [extended attributes](/docs/dbt-cloud-environments#extended-attributes) block with the following payload (replacing `XXX` with your corresponding information):

    ```yaml
    keyfile_json:
      type: service_account
      project_id: xxx
      private_key_id: xxx
      private_key: '{{ env_var(''DBT_ENV_SECRET_PROJECTXXX_PRIVATE_KEY'') }}'
      client_email: xxx
      client_id: xxx
      auth_uri: xxx
      token_uri: xxx
      auth_provider_x509_cert_url: xxx
      client_x509_cert_url: xxx
    ```

    If you require [other fields](/docs/core/connect-data-platform/bigquery-setup#service-account-json) to be overridden at the environment level via extended attributes, please respect the [expected indentation](/docs/dbt-cloud-environments#only-the-top-level-keys-are-accepted-in-extended-attributes) (ordering doesn't matter):

    ```yaml
    priority: interactive
    keyfile_json:
      type: xxx
      project_id: xxx
      private_key_id: xxx
      private_key: '{{ env_var(''DBT_ENV_SECRET_PROJECTXXX_PRIVATE_KEY'') }}'
      client_email: xxx
      client_id: xxx
      auth_uri: xxx
      token_uri: xxx
      auth_provider_x509_cert_url: xxx
      client_x509_cert_url: xxx
    execution_project: buck-stops-here-456
    ```

    To automate your deployment, you first need to [create the extended attributes payload](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cloud/api-v3#/operations/Create%20Extended%20Attributes) for a given project, and then [assign it](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cloud/api-v3#/operations/Update%20Environment) to a specific environment. With `XXXXX` as your account number, `YYYYY` as your project number, and `ZZZZZ` as your [API token](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/authentication):

    ```shell
    curl --request POST \
    --url https://cloud.getdbt.com/api/v3/accounts/XXXXX/projects/YYYYY/extended-attributes/ \
    --header 'Accept: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer ZZZZZ' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
    "id": null,
    "extended_attributes": {"type":"service_account","project_id":"xxx","private_key_id":"xxx","private_key":"{{ env_var('DBT_ENV_SECRET_PROJECTXXX_PRIVATE_KEY')    }}","client_email":"xxx","client_id":xxx,"auth_uri":"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth","token_uri":"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token","auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs","client_x509_cert_url":"xxx"},
    "state": 1
    }'
    ```
    _Make a note of the `id` returned in the message._ It will be used in the following call. With `EEEEE` the environment id, `FFFFF` the extended attributes id: 

    ```shell
    curl --request POST \
    --url https://cloud.getdbt.com/api/v3/accounts/XXXXX/projects/YYYYY/environments/EEEEE/ \
    --header 'Accept: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer ZZZZZZ' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      "extended_attributes_id": FFFFF
    }'
    ```
