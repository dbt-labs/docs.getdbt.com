The following fields are required when creating a Snowflake connection

| Field | Description | Examples |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- |
| Account | The Snowflake account to connect to. Take a look [here](/docs/core/connect-data-platform/snowflake-setup#account) to determine what the account field should look like based on your region.| <Snippet path="snowflake-acct-name" /> |
| Role | A mandatory field indicating what role should be assumed after connecting to Snowflake | `transformer` |
| Database | The logical database to connect to and run queries against. | `analytics` |
| Warehouse | The virtual warehouse to use for running queries. | `transforming` |


**Note:** A crucial part of working with dbt atop Snowflake is ensuring that users (in development environments) and/or service accounts (in deployment to production environments) have the correct permissions to take actions on Snowflake! Here is documentation of some [example permissions to configure Snowflake access](/reference/database-permissions/snowflake-permissions).

## Authentication methods

This section describes the different authentication methods available for connecting dbt Cloud to Snowflake.

### Username / Password

**Available in:** Development environments, Deployment environments

The `Username / Password` auth method is the simplest way to authenticate
Development or Deployment credentials in a dbt project. Simply enter your Snowflake
username (specifically, the `login_name`) and the corresponding user's Snowflake `password`
to authenticate dbt Cloud to run queries against Snowflake on behalf of a Snowflake user.

**Note**: The schema field in the **Developer Credentials** section is a required field.

### Snowflake MFA

**Prerequisites:**
- A development environment in a dbt Cloud project
- The Duo authentication app
- Admin access to Snowflake (if MFA settings haven't already been applied to the account)
- [Admin (write) access](/docs/cloud/manage-access/seats-and-users) to dbt Cloud environments

dbt Cloud supports Snowflake's [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-mfa) as another username and password option for increased login security. Snowflake's MFA support is powered by the Duo Security service.

- In dbt Cloud, set the following [extended attribute](/docs/dbt-cloud-environments#extended-attributes) in the development environment **General settings** page, under the **Extended attributes** section:

   ```yaml
  authenticator: username_password_mfa
   ```

- To reduce the number of user prompts when connecting to Snowflake with MFA, [enable token caching](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-mfa#using-mfa-token-caching-to-minimize-the-number-of-prompts-during-authentication-optional) in Snowflake.
- Optionally, if users miss prompts and their Snowflake accounts get locked, you can prevent automatic retries by adding the following in the same **Extended attributes** section:

  ```yaml
  connect_retries: 0
  ```

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/extended-attributes-mfa.jpg" width="70%" title="Configure the MFA username and password, and connect_retries in the development environment settings." />

### Key pair

**Available in:** Development environments,  Deployment environments

The `Keypair` auth method uses Snowflake's [Key Pair Authentication](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth) to authenticate Development or Deployment credentials for a dbt Cloud project.

1. After [generating an encrypted key pair](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth.html#configuring-key-pair-authentication), be sure to set the `rsa_public_key` for the Snowflake user to authenticate in dbt Cloud:

   ```sql
   alter user jsmith set rsa_public_key='MIIBIjANBgkqh...';   
   ```

2. Finally, set the **Private Key** and **Private Key Passphrase** fields in the **Credentials** page to finish configuring dbt Cloud to authenticate with Snowflake using a key pair.
   - **Note:** Unencrypted private keys are permitted. Use a passphrase only if needed. Starting from [dbt version 1.7](/docs/dbt-versions/core-upgrade/upgrading-to-v1.7), dbt introduced the ability to specify a `private_key` directly as a string instead of a `private_key_path`. This `private_key` string can be in either Base64-encoded DER format, representing the key bytes, or in plain-text PEM format. Refer to [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth) for more info on how they generate the key.

3. To successfully fill in the Private Key field, you _must_ include commented lines. If you receive a `Could not deserialize key data` or `JWT token` error, refer to [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for more info. 

**Example:**

```sql
-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
< encrypted private key contents here - line 1 >
< encrypted private key contents here - line 2 >
< ... >
-----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
```

### Snowflake OAuth

**Available in:** Development environments, Enterprise plans only

The OAuth auth method permits dbt Cloud to run development queries on behalf of
a Snowflake user without the configuration of Snowflake password in dbt Cloud. 

For more information on configuring a Snowflake OAuth connection in dbt Cloud, please see [the docs on setting up Snowflake OAuth](/docs/cloud/manage-access/set-up-snowflake-oauth).
<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/dbt-cloud-enterprise/database-connection-snowflake-oauth.png" width="55%" title="Configuring Snowflake OAuth connection"/>

## Configuration

To learn how to optimize performance with data platform-specific configurations in dbt Cloud, refer to [Snowflake-specific configuration](/reference/resource-configs/snowflake-configs).

### Custom domain URL

To connect to Snowflake through a custom domain (vanity URL) instead of the account locator, use [extended attributes](/docs/dbt-cloud-environments#extended-attributes) to configure the `host` parameter with the custom domain:

```yaml
host: https://custom_domain_to_snowflake.com
```

This configuration may conflict with Snowflake OAuth when used with PrivateLink. IF users can't reach Snowflake authentication servers from a networking standpoint, please [contact dbt Support](mailto:support@getdbt.com) to find a workaround with this architecture.

## Troubleshooting
<!--might need to turn this into details toggle if more troubleshooting items arise -->

If you're receiving a `Could not deserialize key data` or `JWT token` error, refer to the following causes and solutions:

<detailsToggle alt_header="Error: `Could not deserialize key data`">

Possible cause and solution for the error "Could not deserialize key data" in dbt Cloud.
- This could be because of mistakes like not copying correctly, missing dashes, or leaving out commented lines.

**Solution**:
- You can copy the key from its source and paste it into a text editor to verify it before using it in dbt Cloud.

</detailsToggle>

<detailsToggle alt_header="Error: `JWT token`">

Possible cause and solution for the error "JWT token" in dbt Cloud.
- This could be a transient issue between Snowflake and dbt Cloud. When connecting to Snowflake, dbt gets a JWT token valid for only 60 seconds. If there's no response from Snowflake within this time, you might see a `JWT token is invalid` error in dbt Cloud.
- The public key was not entered correctly in Snowflake.

**Solutions**
- dbt needs to retry connections to Snowflake.
- Confirm and enter Snowflake's public key correctly. Additionally, you can reach out to Snowflake for help or refer to this Snowflake doc for more info: [Key-Based Authentication Failed with JWT token is invalid Error](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/Key-Based-Authentication-Failed-with-JWT-token-is-invalid-Error).
