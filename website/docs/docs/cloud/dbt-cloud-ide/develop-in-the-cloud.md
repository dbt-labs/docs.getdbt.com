The dbt Cloud integrated development environment (IDE) is a single web-based interface for building, testing, running, and version-controlling dbt projects. It compiles dbt code into SQL and executes it directly on your database. 

The dbt Cloud IDE offers several [keyboard shortcuts](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/keyboard-shortcuts) and [editing features](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/ide-user-interface#editing-features) for faster and efficient development and governance:

- Syntax highlighting for SQL &mdash; Makes it easy to distinguish different parts of your code, reducing syntax errors and enhancing readability.
- AI copilot &mdash; Use [dbt Copilot](/docs/cloud/dbt-copilot), a powerful AI engine that can generate documentation, tests, and semantic models for your dbt SQL models.
- Auto-completion &mdash; Suggests table names, arguments, and column names as you type, saving time and reducing typos.
- Code [formatting and linting](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/lint-format) &mdash; Helps standardize and fix your SQL code effortlessly.
- Navigation tools &mdash; Easily move around your code, jump to specific lines, find and replace text, and navigate between project files.
- Version control &mdash; Manage code versions with a few clicks.
- Project documentation &mdash; Generate and view your [project documentation](#build-and-document-your-projects) for your dbt project in real-time.
- Build, test, and run button &mdash; Build, test, and run your project with a button click or by using the Cloud IDE command bar.  

These [features](#dbt-cloud-ide-features) create a powerful editing environment for efficient SQL coding, suitable for both experienced and beginner developers.

### Code generation

The dbt Cloud IDE comes with **CodeGenCodeLens**, a powerful feature that simplifies creating models from your sources with a click of a button. To use this feature, click on the  **Generate model** action next to each table in the source YAML file(s). It automatically creates a basic starting staging model for you to expand on. This feature helps streamline your workflow by automating the first steps of model generation.

### dbt YAML validation

Use dbt-jsonschema to validate dbt YAML files, helping you leverage the autocomplete and assistance capabilities of the dbt Cloud IDE. This also provides immediate feedback on YAML file structure and syntax, helping you make sure your project configurations meet the required standards.

## Get started with the Cloud IDE

In order to start experiencing the great features of the Cloud IDE, you need to first set up a [dbt Cloud development environment](/docs/dbt-cloud-environments). In the following steps, we outline how to set up developer credentials and access the IDE. If you're creating a new project, you will automatically configure this during the project setup. 

The IDE uses developer credentials to connect to your data platform. These developer credentials should be specific to your user and they should *not* be super user credentials or the same credentials that you use for your production deployment of dbt.

Set up your developer credentials:

1. Navigate to your **Credentials** under **Your Profile** settings, which you can access at `https://YOUR_ACCESS_URL/settings/profile#credentials`, replacing `YOUR_ACCESS_URL` with the [appropriate Access URL](/docs/cloud/about-cloud/access-regions-ip-addresses) for your region and plan.
2. Select the relevant project in the list.
3. Click **Edit** on the bottom right of the page.
4. Enter the details under **Development Credentials**.
5. Click **Save.**

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/refresh-ide/dev-credentials.jpg" width="85%" height="100" title="Configure developer credentials in your Profile"/>

6. Access the Cloud IDE by clicking **Develop** at the top of the page.
7. Initialize your project and familiarize yourself with the IDE and its delightful [features](#cloud-ide-features).

Nice job, you're ready to start developing and building models 🎉!  

### Considerations
- To improve your experience using dbt Cloud, we suggest that you turn off ad blockers. This is because some project file names, such as `google_adwords.sql`, might resemble ad traffic and trigger ad blockers.
- To preserve performance, there's a file size limitation for repositories over 6 GB. If you have a repo over 6 GB, please contact [dbt Support](mailto:support@getdbt.com) before running dbt Cloud.
- The IDE's idle session timeout is one hour.
- <Expandable alt_header="About the start up process and work retention">
  
  ### Start-up process
  There are three start-up states when using or launching the Cloud IDE:
  - **Creation start &mdash;** This is the state where you are starting the IDE for the first time. You can also view this as a *cold start* (see below), and you can expect this state to take longer because the git repository is being cloned.
  - **Cold start &mdash;** This is the process of starting a new develop session, which will be available for you for one hour. The environment automatically turns off one hour after the last activity. This includes compile, preview, or any dbt invocation, however, it *does not* include editing and saving a file.
  - **Hot start &mdash;** This is the state of resuming an existing or active develop session within one hour of the last activity.

  ### Work retention
  The Cloud IDE needs explicit action to save your changes. There are three ways your work is stored:

  - **Unsaved, local code &mdash;** The browser stores your code only in its local storage. In this state, you might need to commit any unsaved changes in order to switch branches or browsers. If you have saved and committed changes, you can access the "Change branch" option even if there are unsaved changes. But if you attempt to switch branches without saving changes, a warning message will appear, notifying you that you will lose any unsaved changes.

  <Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-ide/ide-unsaved-modal.jpg" width="85%" title="If you attempt to switch branches without saving changes, a warning message will appear, telling you that you will lose your changes."/>

  - **Saved but uncommitted code &mdash;** When you save a file, the data gets stored in durable, long-term storage, but isn't synced back to git. To switch branches using the **Change branch** option, you must "Commit and sync" or "Revert" changes. Changing branches isn't available for saved-but-uncommitted code. This is to ensure your uncommitted changes don't get lost.
  - **Committed code &mdash;** This is stored in the branch with your git provider and you can check out other (remote) branches.

## Build and document your projects

- **Build, compile, and run projects** &mdash; You can *build*, *compile*, *run*, and *test* dbt projects using the command bar or **Build** button. Use the **Build** button to quickly build, run, or test the model you're working on. The Cloud IDE will update in real time when you run models, tests, seeds, and operations.
  - If a model or test fails, dbt Cloud makes it easy for you to view and download the run logs for your dbt invocations to fix the issue.
  - Use dbt's [rich model selection syntax](/reference/node-selection/syntax) to [run dbt commands](/reference/dbt-commands) directly within dbt Cloud.
  - Starting from dbt v1.6, leverage [environments variables](/docs/build/environment-variables#special-environment-variables) to dynamically use the Git branch name. For example, using the branch name as a prefix for a development schema.
  - Run [MetricFlow commands](/docs/build/metricflow-commands) to create and manage metrics in your project with the [dbt Semantic Layer](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/dbt-sl).

- **Generate your YAML configurations with dbt Copilot** <Lifecycle status="beta"/>  &mdash; [dbt Copilot](/docs/cloud/dbt-copilot) is a powerful artificial intelligence (AI) feature that helps automate development in dbt Cloud. It can generate documentation, tests, and semantic models for your dbt SQL models directly in the dbt Cloud IDE, with a click of a button, and helps you accomplish more in less time. Available for dbt Cloud Enterprise plans.

- **Build and view your project's docs** &mdash; The dbt Cloud IDE makes it possible to [build and view](/docs/collaborate/build-and-view-your-docs) documentation for your dbt project while your code is still in development. With this workflow, you can inspect and verify what your project's generated documentation will look like before your changes are released to production.
