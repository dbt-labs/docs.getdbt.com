# dbt Cloud tips

The Cloud IDE provides keyboard shortcuts, features, and development tips to help you work faster and be more productive. Use this Cloud IDE cheat sheet to help you quickly reference some common operations.

## Cloud IDE Keyboard shortcuts

There are default keyboard shortcuts that can help make development more productive and easier for everyone.

- Press Fn-F1 to view a full list of the editor shortcuts
- Command-O on macOS or Control-O on Windows to select a file to open
- Command-P/Command-Shift-P on macOS or Control-P/Control-Shift-P on Windows to see the command palette
- Hold Option-click-on-area on macOS or Hold-Alt-click-on-area on Windows to select multiple lines and perform a multi-edit. You can also press Command-E to perform this operation on the command line.
- Command-Enter on macOS or Control-Enter on Windows to Preview your code
- Command-Shift-Enter on macOS or Control-Shift-Enter on Windows to Compile
- Highlight a portion of code and use the above shortcuts to Preview or Compile code
- Enter two underscores (__) in the IDE to reveal a list of dbt functions
- Press Control-backtick (or Ctrl + `) to toggle the Invocation history
- Press Command-Option-forward slash on macOS or Control-Alt-forward slash on Windows on the selected code to add a block comment. SQL files will use the Jinja syntax `({# #})` rather than the SQL one `(/* */)`. Markdown files will use the Markdown syntax `(<!-- -->)`
- Option-W on macOS or Alt-W on Windows will close the currently active editor tab


## Package tips

- Use the [dbt_codegen](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/codegen/latest/) package to help you generate YML files for your models and sources and SQL files for your staging models.
- The [dbt_utils](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/dbt_utils/latest/) package contains macros useful for daily development. For example, `date_spine` generates a table with all dates between the ones provided as parameters.
- The [dbt_project_evaluator](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/dbt_project_evaluator/latest) package compares your dbt project against a list of our best practices and provides suggestions and guidelines on how to update your models.
- The [dbt_expectations](https://hub.getdbt.com/calogica/dbt_expectations/latest) package contains many tests beyond those built into dbt Core.
- The [dbt_audit_helper](https://hub.getdbt.com/#:~:text=adwords-,audit_helper,-codegen) package lets you compare the output of 2 queries. Use it when refactoring existing logic to ensure that the new results are identical.
- The [dbt_artifacts](https://hub.getdbt.com/brooklyn-data/dbt_artifacts/latest) package saves information about your dbt runs directly to your data platform so that you can track the performance of models over time.
- The [dbt_meta_testing](https://hub.getdbt.com/tnightengale/dbt_meta_testing/latest) package checks that your dbt project is sufficiently tested and documented.

## Advanced tips

- Use your folder structure as your primary selector method. `dbt build --select marts.marketing` is simpler and more resilient than relying on tagging every model.
- Think about jobs in terms of build cadences and SLAs. Run models that have hourly, daily, or weekly build cadences together.
- Use the [where config](/reference/resource-configs/where) for tests to test an assertion on a subset of records.
- [store_failures](/reference/resource-configs/store_failures) lets you examine records that cause tests to fail, so you can either repair the data or change the test as needed.
- Use [severity](/reference/resource-configs/severity) thresholds to set an acceptable number of failures for a test.
- Use [incremental_strategy](/docs/build/incremental-models#about-incremental_strategy) in your incremental model config to implement the most effective behavior depending on the volume of your data and reliability of your unique keys.
- Set `vars` in your `dbt_project.yml` to define global defaults for certain conditions, which you can then override using the `--vars` flag in your commands.
- Use [for loops](/guides/advanced/using-jinja#use-a-for-loop-in-models-for-repeated-sql) in Jinja to [DRY](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/dry) up repetitive logic, such as selecting a series of columns that all require the same transformations and naming patterns to be applied.
- Instead of relying on post-hooks, use the [grants config](/reference/resource-configs/grants) to apply permission grants in the warehouse resiliently.
- Define [source-freshness](/docs/build/sources#snapshotting-source-data-freshness) thresholds on your sources to avoid running transformations on data that has already been processed.
- Use the `+` operator on the left of a model `dbt build --select +model_name` to run a model and all of its upstream dependencies. Use the `+` operator on the right of the model `dbt build --select model_name+` to run a model and everything downstream that depends on it.
- Use `dir_name` to run all models in a package or directory.
- Use the `@` operator on the left of a model in a non-state-aware CI setup to test it. This operator runs all of a selection’s parents and children, and also runs the parents of its children, which in a fresh CI schema will likely not exist yet.
- Use the [--exclude flag](/reference/node-selection/exclude) to remove a subset of models out of a selection.
- Use the [--full-refresh](/reference/commands/run#refresh-incremental-models) flag to rebuild an incremental model from scratch.
- Use [seeds](/docs/build/seeds) to create manual lookup tables, like zip codes to states or marketing UTMs to campaigns. `dbt seed` will build these from CSVs into your warehouse and make them `ref` able in your models.
- Use [target.name](/docs/build/custom-schemas#an-alternative-pattern-for-generating-schema-names) to pivot logic based on what environment you’re using. For example, to build into a single development schema while developing, but use multiple schemas in production.
