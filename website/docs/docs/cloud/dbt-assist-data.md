dbt Labs is committed to protecting your privacy and data. This page provides information about how dbt Labs handles your data when you use dbt Assist.

- #### Is my data used by dbt Labs to train AI models?
  No, dbt Labs does not use your prompts to train any internal dbt Labs AI model. It uses API calls to the AI vendor you provide, or, if you choose to use our AI provider, to our AI provider. dbt Labs is not a party to the agreement between you and your AI vendor, and cannot advise as to what rights and obligations it provides.

- #### Does dbt Labs share my personal data with third parties
  dbt Labs only shares client personal information as needed to perform the services, under client instructions, or for legal, tax or compliance reasons.

- #### Does dbt Assist store or use personal data?
  dbt Assist only stores ephemerally any data input by the user. The user clicks the AI assist button. Ephemeral storage cannot be accessed or used by dbt Labs employees, and ephemeral storage does not persist on dbt Labs systems.

- #### Does dbt Assist access my warehouse data?
  dbt Assist utilizes the user’s prompt to initiate a search via client’s API of the client’s model provided by its AI vendor and returns probable output. Such output must be double-checked by the user for completeness and accuracy. This does not involve the use of client’s warehouse data.

- #### Can dbt Assist data be deleted upon client written request
  dbt Assist data, aside from usage data, does not persist on dbt Labs systems. Therefore, dbt Labs should not have possession of any data requiring deletion. Usage data is retained by dbt Labs, but users are advised to not include personal or sensitive information in the prompts. To the extent data is used to train AI models, that would be governed by the agreement between client and its AI Vendor, and dbt Labs is not a party to that agreement.
