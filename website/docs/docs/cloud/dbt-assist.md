# About dbt Assist <Lifecycle status='beta'/> 

dbt Assist is a powerful artificial intelligence (AI) co-pilot feature that helps automate development in dbt Cloud, allowing you to focus on delivering data that works. dbt Assist’s AI co-pilot generates [documentation](/docs/build/documentation), [semantic models](/docs/build/semantic-models), and [tests](/docs/build/data-tests) for your SQL models directly in the dbt Cloud IDE, with a click of a button, and helps you accomplish more in less time.
