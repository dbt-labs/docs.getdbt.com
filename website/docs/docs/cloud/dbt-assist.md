# About dbt Copilot <Lifecycle status='beta'/> 

The dbt Copilot experience is a powerful artificial intelligence (AI) feature that helps automate development in dbt Cloud, allowing you to focus on delivering data that works. dbt Copilot generates [documentation](/docs/build/documentation) and [tests](/docs/build/data-tests) for your dbt SQL models directly in the dbt Cloud IDE, with a click of a button, and helps you accomplish more in less time.
