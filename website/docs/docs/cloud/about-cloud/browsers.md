### Browser sessions

A session is a period of time during which youâ€™re signed in to a dbt Cloud account from a browser. If you close your browser, it will end your session and log you out. You'll need to log in again the next time you try to access dbt Cloud. 

If you've logged in using [SSO](/docs/cloud/manage-access/sso-overview) or [OAuth](/docs/cloud/git/connect-github#personally-authenticate-with-github), you can customize your maximum session duration, which might vary depending on your identity provider (IdP).
