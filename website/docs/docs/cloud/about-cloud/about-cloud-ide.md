The dbt Cloud integrated development environment (IDE) is a single interface for building, testing, running, and version-controlling dbt projects from your browser. With the Cloud IDE, you can compile dbt code into SQL and run it against your database directly.


With the Cloud IDE, you can:

- Write modular SQL models with select statements and the ref() function,
- Compile dbt code into SQL and execute it against your database directly,
- Test every model before deploying them to production,
- Generate and view documentation of your dbt project,
- Leverage git and version-control your code from your browser with a couple of clicks,
- Create and test Python models:
    * Compile Python models to see the full function that gets executed in your data platform
    * See Python models in DAG in dbt version 1.3 and higher
    * Currently, you can't preview python models
- Visualize a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and more.
