:::warning Alpha functionality 

The following installation instructions are for the dbt Cloud CLI, currently in Alpha (actively in development and being tested). 

These instructions are not intended for general audiences at this time.

## Installing dbt Cloud CLI

### Install and update with Brew on MacOS (recommended)

1. Install the dbt Cloud CLI: 

```bash
brew tap dbt-labs/dbt-cli
brew install dbt-cloud-cli
```

2. Verify the installation by requesting your homebrew installation path (not your dbt core installs). If the `which dbt` command returns nothing, then you should modify your PATH in `~.zshrc` or create an alias.

```bash
which dbt
dbt --help
```

### Manually install (Windows and Linux)

1. Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-cli/releases).
2. Add the `dbt` executable to your path.
3. Move to a directory with a dbt project, and create a `dbt_cloud.yml` file containing your `project-id` from dbt Cloud.
4. Invoke `dbt --help` from your terminal to see a list of supported commands.

#### Updating your dbt Cloud installation (Windows + Linux)

Follow the same process in [Installing dbt Cloud CLI](#manually-install-windows-only) and replace the existing `dbt` executable with the new one. You should not have to go through the security steps again.

## Setting up the CLI

The following instructions are for setting up the dbt Cloud CLI. 

1. Ensure that you have created a project in [dbt Cloud](https://cloud.getdbt.com/).

2. Ensure that your personal [development credentials](https://cloud.getdbt.com/settings/profile/credentials) are set on the project.

3. Navigate to [your profile](https://cloud.getdbt.com/settings/profile) and enable the **Beta** flag under **Experimental Features.**

4. Create an environment variable with your [dbt Cloud API key](https://cloud.getdbt.com/settings/profile#api-access):

```bash
vi ~/.zshrc

# dbt Cloud CLI
export DBT_CLOUD_API_KEY="1234" # Replace "1234" with your API key   
```

5. Load the new environment variable. Note: You may need to reactivate your Python virtual environment after sourcing your shell's dot file. Alternatively, restart your shell instead of sourcing the shell's dot file

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

6. Navigate to a dbt project

```bash
cd ~/dbt-projects/jaffle_shop
```

7. Create a `dbt_cloud.yml` in the root project directory. The file is required to have a `project-id` field with a valid [project ID](#glossary). Enter the following commands:

```bash
pwd # Input
/Users/user/dbt-projects/jaffle_shop # Output
```

```bash
echo "project-id: '<your project id>'" > dbt_cloud.yml # Input
```

```bash
cat dbt_cloud.yml # Input
project-id: '123456' # Output 
```

You can find your project ID by selecting your project and clicking on **Develop** in the navigation bar. Your project ID is the number in the URL: https://cloud.getdbt.com/develop/26228/projects/PROJECT_ID.

If `dbt_cloud.yml` already exists, edit the file, and verify the project ID field uses a valid project ID.

#### Upgrade the CLI with Brew

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade dbt-cloud-cli
```
