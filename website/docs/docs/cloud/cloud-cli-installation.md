dbt Cloud natively supports developing using a command line (CLI), empowering team members to contribute with enhanced flexibility and collaboration. The dbt Cloud CLI allows you to run dbt commands against your dbt Cloud development environment from your local command line.

dbt commands are run against dbt Cloud's infrastructure and benefit from:

* Secure credential storage in the dbt Cloud platform.
* [Automatic deferral](/docs/cloud/about-cloud-develop-defer) of build artifacts to your Cloud project's production environment. 
* Speedier, lower-cost builds.
* Support for dbt Mesh ([cross-project `ref`](/docs/collaborate/govern/project-dependencies)),
* Significant platform improvements, to be released over the coming months.


## Prerequisites 
The dbt Cloud CLI is available in all [deployment regions](/docs/cloud/about-cloud/access-regions-ip-addresses) and for both multi-tenant and single-tenant accounts (Azure single-tenant not supported at this time).

- Ensure you are using dbt version 1.5 or higher. Refer to [dbt Cloud versions](/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-core-in-cloud) to upgrade.
- Note that SSH tunneling for [Postgres and Redshift](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/connect-redshift-postgresql-alloydb) connections and [Single sign-on (SSO)](/docs/cloud/manage-access/sso-overview) doesn't support the dbt Cloud CLI yet.

## Install dbt Cloud CLI

You can install the dbt Cloud CLI on the command line by using one of these methods.

<Tabs queryString="install">
	
<TabItem value="brew" label="macOS (brew)">

Before you begin, make sure you have [Homebrew installed](http://brew.sh/) in your code editor or command line terminal. Refer to the [FAQs](#faqs) if your operating system runs into path conflicts. 

1. Verify that you don't already have dbt Core installed:
   
  ```bash
  which dbt
  ```
   - If you see a `dbt not found`, you're good to go. If the dbt help text appears, use `pip uninstall dbt` to remove dbt Core from your system. <br />
  
2. Install the dbt Cloud CLI with Homebrew: 

   - First, remove the dbt-labs tap, the separate repository for packages, from Homebrew. This prevents Homebrew from installing packages from that repository:
      ```bash
      brew untap dbt-labs/dbt
   -  Then, add and install the dbt Cloud CLI as a package:
      ```bash
      brew tap dbt-labs/dbt-cli
      brew install dbt
      ```
      If you have multiple taps, use `brew install dbt-labs/dbt-cli/dbt`.

3. Verify your installation by running `dbt --help` in the command line. If you see the following output, your installation is correct:
      ```bash
      The dbt Cloud CLI - an ELT tool for running SQL transformations and data models in dbt Cloud...
      ```

     If you don't see this output, check that you've deactivated pyenv or venv and don't have a global dbt version installed.
   
   * Note that you no longer need to run the `dbt deps` command when your environment starts. This step was previously required during initialization. However, you should still run `dbt deps` if you make any changes to your `packages.yml` file.

4. Clone your repository to your local computer using `git clone`. For example, to clone a GitHub repo using HTTPS format, run `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY`.

5. After cloning your repo, [configure](/docs/cloud/configure-cloud-cli) the dbt Cloud CLI for your dbt Cloud project. This lets you run dbt commands like `dbt compile` to compile your project and validate models and tests. You can also add, edit, and synchronize files with your repo.


</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows (native executable)">

Refer to the [FAQs](#faqs) if your operating system runs into path conflicts.

1. Download the latest Windows release for your platform from [GitHub](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-cli/releases).

2. Extract the `dbt.exe` executable into the same folder as your dbt project.

:::info

Advanced users can configure multiple projects to use the same dbt Cloud CLI by placing the executable in the Program Files folder and [adding it to their Windows PATH environment variable](https://medium.com/@kevinmarkvi/how-to-add-executables-to-your-path-in-windows-5ffa4ce61a53).

Note that if you are using VS Code, you must restart it to pick up modified environment variables.
:::

3. Verify your installation by running `./dbt --help` in the command line. If you see the following output, your installation is correct:
      ```bash
      The dbt Cloud CLI - an ELT tool for running SQL transformations and data models in dbt Cloud...
      ```

     If you don't see this output, check that you've deactivated pyenv or venv and don't have a global dbt version installed.
   
   * Note that you no longer need to run the `dbt deps` command when your environment starts. This step was previously required during initialization. However, you should still run `dbt deps` if you make any changes to your `packages.yml` file.

4. Clone your repository to your local computer using `git clone`. For example, to clone a GitHub repo using HTTPS format, run `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY`.

5. After cloning your repo, [configure](/docs/cloud/configure-cloud-cli) the dbt Cloud CLI for your dbt Cloud project. This lets you run dbt commands like `dbt compile` to compile your project and validate models and tests. You can also add, edit, and synchronize files with your repo.

<TabItem value="pip" label="Existing dbt Core users (pip)">

If you already have dbt Core installed, the dbt Cloud CLI may conflict. Here are some considerations:

- **Prevent conflicts** <br /> Use both the dbt Cloud CLI and dbt Core with `pip` and create a new virtual environment.<br /><br />
- **Use both dbt Cloud CLI and dbt Core with brew or native installs** <br /> If you use Homebrew, consider aliasing the dbt Cloud CLI as "dbt-cloud" to avoid conflict. For more details, check the [FAQs](#faqs) if your operating system experiences path conflicts.<br /><br />
- **Reverting back to dbt Core from the dbt Cloud CLI** <br />
  If you've already installed the dbt Cloud CLI and need to switch back to dbt Core:<br />
  - Uninstall the dbt Cloud CLI using the command: `pip uninstall dbt`
  - Reinstall dbt Core using the following command, replacing "adapter_name" with the appropriate adapter name:
    ```shell
    python -m pip install dbt-adapter_name --force-reinstall
    ```
    For example, if I used Snowflake as an adapter, I would run: `python -m pip install dbt-snowflake --force-reinstall`

--------

Before installing the dbt Cloud CLI, make sure you have Python installed and your virtual environment venv or pyenv . If you already have a Python environment configured, you can skip to the [pip installation step](#install-dbt-cloud-cli-in-pip).

### Install a virtual environment

We recommend using virtual environments (venv) to namespace `cloud-cli`.

1. Create a new virtual environment named "dbt-cloud" with this command:
   ```shell
   python3 -m venv dbt-cloud
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment each time you create a shell window or session, depending on your operating system:

   - For Mac and Linux, use: `source dbt-cloud/bin/activate`<br/>
   - For Windows, use: `dbt-env\Scripts\activate` 

3. (Mac and Linux only) Create an alias to activate your dbt environment with every new shell window or session. You can add the following to your shell's configuration file (for example, `$HOME/.bashrc, $HOME/.zshrc`) while replacing `<PATH_TO_VIRTUAL_ENV_CONFIG>` with the path to your virtual environment configuration:
   ```shell
   alias env_dbt='source <PATH_TO_VIRTUAL_ENV_CONFIG>/bin/activate'
   ```

### Install dbt Cloud CLI in pip

1. (Optional) If you already have dbt Core installed, this installation will override that package. Check your dbt Core version in case you need to reinstall it later by running the following command :

  ```bash
  dbt --version
  ```

2. Make sure you're in your virtual environment and run the following command to install the dbt Cloud CLI:

  ```bash
  pip install dbt --no-cache-dir
  ```

3. (Optional) To revert to dbt Core, first uninstall both the dbt Cloud CLI and dbt Core. Then reinstall dbt Core.

  ```bash
  pip uninstall dbt-core dbt
  pip install dbt-adapter_name --force-reinstall
  ```

4. Clone your repository to your local computer using `git clone`. For example, to clone a GitHub repo using HTTPS format, run `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY`.

5. After cloning your repo, [configure](/docs/cloud/configure-cloud-cli) the dbt Cloud CLI for your dbt Cloud project. This lets you run dbt commands like `dbt compile` to compile your project and validate models and tests. You can also add, edit, and synchronize files with your repo.

## Using VS Code extensions

Visual Studio (VS) Code extensions enhance command line tools by adding extra functionalities. The dbt Cloud CLI is fully compatible with dbt Core, however it doesn't support some dbt Core APIs required by certain tools, for example VS Code extensions. 

To use these extensions, such as dbt-power-user, with the dbt Cloud CLI, you can install it using Homebrew (along with dbt Core) and create an alias to run the dbt Cloud CLI as `dbt-cloud`. This allows dbt-power-user to continue to invoke dbt Core under the hood, alongside the dbt Cloud CLI.


## FAQs

<details>

<summary>What's the difference between the dbt Cloud CLI and dbt Core?</summary>
The dbt Cloud CLI and <a href="https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core">dbt Core</a>, an open-source project, are both command line tools that enable you to run dbt commands. The key distinction is the dbt Cloud CLI is tailored for dbt Cloud's infrastructure and integrates with all its <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/about-cloud/dbt-cloud-features">features</a>.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I run both the dbt Cloud CLI and dbt Core?</summary>
For compatibility, both the dbt Cloud CLI and dbt Core are invoked by running <code>dbt</code>. This can create path conflicts if your operating system selects one over the other based on your $PATH environment variable (settings).<br />

If you have dbt Core installed locally, either:

1. Install using the <code>pip3 install dbt</code> [pip](/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation?install=pip#install-dbt-cloud-cli) command.
2. Install natively, ensuring you either deactivate the virtual environment containing dbt Core or create an alias for the dbt Cloud CLI. 
3. (Advanced users) Install natively, but modify the $PATH environment variable to correctly point to the dbt Cloud CLI binary to use both dbt Cloud CLI and dbt Core together.

You can always uninstall the dbt Cloud CLI to return to using dbt Core.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How to create an alias?</summary>
To create an alias for the dbt Cloud CLI: <br />

1. Open your shell's profile configuration file. Depending on your shell and system, this could be <code>~/.bashrc</code>, <code>~/.bash_profile</code>, <code>~/.zshrc</code>, or another file.<br />

2. Add an alias that points to the dbt Cloud CLI binary. For example:<code>alias dbt-cloud="path_to_dbt_cloud_cli_binary</code>
   
   Replace <code>path_to_dbt_cloud_cli_binary</code> with the actual path to the dbt Cloud CLI binary, which is <code>/opt/homebrew/bin/dbt</code>. With this alias, you can use the command <code>dbt-cloud</code> to invoke the dbt Cloud CLI.<br />

3. Save the file and then either restart your shell or run <code>source</code> on the profile file to apply the changes.
As an example, in bash you would run: <code>source ~/.bashrc</code><br />

1. Test and use the alias to run commands:<br />
   - To run the dbt Cloud CLI, use the <code>dbt-cloud</code> command: <code>dbt-cloud command_name</code>. Replace 'command_name' with the specific dbt command you want to execute.<br />
   - To run the dbt Core, use the <code>dbt</code> command: <code>dbt command_name</code>. Replace 'command_name' with the specific dbt command you want to execute.<br />


This alias will allow you to use the <code>dbt-cloud</code> command to invoke the dbt Cloud CLI while having dbt Core installed natively.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why am I receiving a <code>Session occupied</code> error?</summary>
If you've ran a dbt command and receive a <code>Session occupied</code> error, you can reattach to your existing session with <code>dbt reattach</code> and then press <code>Control-C</code> and choose to cancel the invocation.
