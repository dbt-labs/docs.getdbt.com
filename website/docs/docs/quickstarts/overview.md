dbt Core is a powerful open-source tool for [data transformations](https://www.getdbt.com/analytics-engineering/transformation/), and dbt Cloud is the fastest and most reliable way to deploy your dbt jobs. With the help of a sample project, learn how to quickly start using dbt and one of the most common data platforms. 

The quickstarts will show you how to set up dbt and perform some key tasks. These tasks will illustrate how dbt establishes standard practices for your work such as using Git to version control your analytics code, testing your models to validate they are working correctly, documenting your models in detail to better collaborate with others, and scheduling jobs to execute at designated times.  

Before you begin, you will need:

* Warehouse with sample data. If you don't have this, you can use the [BigQuery project](/docs/quickstarts/dbt-cloud/bigquery), which leverages public data sets.
* Basic understanding of [Git](https://git-scm.com/doc).
* Basic understanding of [SQL](https://www.sqltutorial.org/).
