This guide introduces MetricFlow's fundamental ideas for people new to this feature. MetricFlow, which powers the dbt Semantic Layer, helps you define and manage the logic for your company's metrics. It's an opinionated set of abstractions and helps data consumers retrieve metric datasets from a data platform quickly and efficiently.

MetricFlow handles SQL query construction and defines the specification for dbt semantic models and metrics. It allows you to define metrics in your dbt project and query them with [MetricFlow commands](/docs/build/metricflow-commands) whether in dbt Cloud or dbt Core.

Before you start, consider the following guidelines:

- Define metrics in YAML and query them using these [new metric specifications](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/discussions/7456).
- You must be on [dbt version](/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-dbt-version-in-cloud) 1.6 or higher to use MetricFlow. 
- Use MetricFlow with Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, Postgres (dbt Core only), or Redshift. 
- Discover insights and query your metrics using the [dbt Semantic Layer](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/dbt-sl) and its diverse range of [available integrations](/docs/cloud-integrations/avail-sl-integrations). 

## MetricFlow

MetricFlow is a SQL query generation tool designed to streamline metric creation across different data dimensions for diverse business needs. 
- It operates through YAML files, where a semantic graph links language to data. This graph comprises [semantic models](/docs/build/semantic-models) (data entry points) and [metrics](/docs/build/metrics-overview) (functions for creating quantitative indicators).
- MetricFlow is a [BSL package](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow) with code source available, and compatible with dbt version 1.6 and higher. Data practitioners and enthusiasts are highly encouraged to contribute.
- As a part of the dbt Semantic Layer, MetricFlow empowers organizations to define metrics using YAML abstractions.
- To query metric dimensions, dimension values, and validate configurations, use [MetricFlow commands](/docs/build/metricflow-commands).


**Note** &mdash; MetricFlow doesn't support dbt [builtin functions or packages](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/builtins) at this time, however, support is planned for the future.

MetricFlow abides by these principles:

- **Flexibility with completeness**: Define metric logic using flexible abstractions on any data model.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Minimize redundancy by enabling metric definitions whenever possible.
- **Simplicity with gradual complexity:** Approach MetricFlow using familiar data modeling concepts.
- **Performance and efficiency**: Optimize performance while supporting centralized data engineering and distributed logic ownership.

### Semantic graph

We're introducing a new concept: a "semantic graph". It's the relationship between semantic models and YAML configurations that creates a data landscape for building metrics. You can think of it like a map, where tables are like locations, and the connections between them (edges) are like roads. Although it's under the hood, the semantic graph is a subset of the <Term id="dag" />, and you can see the semantic models as nodes on the DAG.

The semantic graph helps us decide which information is available to use for consumption and which is not. The connections between tables in the semantic graph are more about relationships between the information. This is different from the DAG, where the connections show dependencies between tasks.

When MetricFlow generates a metric, it uses its SQL engine to figure out the best path between tables using the framework defined in YAML files for semantic models and metrics. When these models and metrics are correctly defined, they can be used downstream with dbt Semantic Layer's integrations.

### Semantic models 

Semantic models are the starting points of data and correspond to models in your dbt project. You can create multiple semantic models from each model. Semantic models have metadata, like a data table, that define important information such as the table name and primary keys for the graph to be navigated correctly.

For a semantic model, there are three main pieces of metadata:

* [Entities](/docs/build/entities) &mdash; The join keys of your semantic model (think of these as the traversal paths, or edges between semantic models).
* [Dimensions](/docs/build/dimensions) &mdash; These are the ways you want to group or slice/dice your metrics.
* [Measures](/docs/build/measures) &mdash; The aggregation functions that give you a numeric result and can be used to create your metrics.

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/semantic-layer/semantic_foundation.jpg" width="70%" title="A semantic model is made up of different components: Entities, Measures, and Dimensions."/>

### Metrics 

Metrics, which is a key concept, are functions that combine measures, constraints, or other mathematical functions to define new quantitative indicators. MetricFlow uses measures and various aggregation types, such as average, sum, and count distinct, to create metrics.  Dimensions add context to metrics and without them, a metric is simply a number for all time. You can define metrics in the same YAML files as your semantic models, or create a new file.

MetricFlow supports different metric types:

- [Conversion](/docs/build/conversion) &mdash; Helps you track when a base event and a subsequent conversion event occurs for an entity within a set time period.
- [Cumulative](/docs/build/cumulative) &mdash;  Aggregates a measure over a given window.
- [Derived](/docs/build/derived) &mdash; An expression of other metrics, which allows you to do calculations on top of metrics.
- [Ratio](/docs/build/ratio) &mdash; Create a ratio out of two measures, like revenue per customer.
- [Simple](/docs/build/simple) &mdash; Metrics that refer directly to one measure. 

## Use case

In the upcoming sections, we'll show how data practitioners currently calculate metrics and compare it to how MetricFlow makes defining metrics easier and more flexible. 

The following example data is based on the Jaffle Shop repo. You can view the complete [dbt project](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle-sl-template). The tables we're using in our example model are:

- `orders` is a production data platform export that has been cleaned up and organized for analytical consumption
- `customers` is a partially denormalized table in this case with a column derived from the orders table through some upstream process

<!-- ![MetricFlow-SchemaExample](/img/docs/building-a-dbt-project/MetricFlow-SchemaExample.jpeg) -->

To make this more concrete, consider the metric `order_total`, which is defined using the SQL expression:

`select sum(order_total) as order_total from orders` 
This expression calculates the total revenue for all orders by summing the order_total column in the orders table. In a business setting, the metric order_total is often calculated according to different categories, such as"
- Time, for example `date_trunc(ordered_at, 'day')`
- Order Type, using `is_food_order` dimension from the `orders` table.

### Calculate metrics

Next, we'll compare how data practitioners currently calculate metrics with multiple queries versus how MetricFlow simplifies and streamlines the process.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="mulqueries" label="Calculate with multiple queries">

The following example displays how data practitioners typically would calculate the `order_total` metric aggregated. It's also likely that analysts are asked for more details on a metric, like how much revenue came from new customers. 

Using the following query creates a situation where multiple analysts working on the same data, each using their own query method &mdash; this can lead to confusion, inconsistencies, and a headache for data management.

```sql
select
    date_trunc('day',orders.ordered_at) as day, 
    case when customers.first_ordered_at is not null then true else false end as is_new_customer,
    sum(orders.order_total) as order_total
from
  orders
left join
  customers
on
  orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
group by 1, 2
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="metricflow" label="Calculate with MetricFlow">

In the following three example tabs, use MetricFlow to define a semantic model that uses order_total as a metric and a sample schema to create consistent and accurate results &mdash; eliminating confusion, code duplication, and streamlining your workflow.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="example1" label="Revenue example">

In this example, a measure named `order_total` is defined based on the order_total column in the `orders` table. 

The time dimension `metric_time` provides daily granularity and can be aggregated into weekly or monthly time periods. Additionally, a categorical dimension called `is_new_customer` is specified in the `customers` semantic model.


```yaml
semantic_models:
  - name: orders    # The name of the semantic model
    description: |
      A model containing order data. The grain of the table is the order id.
    model: ref('orders') #The name of the dbt model and schema
    defaults:
      agg_time_dimension: metric_time
    entities: # Entities, which usually correspond to keys in the table. 
      - name: order_id
        type: primary
      - name: customer
        type: foreign
        expr: customer_id
    measures:   # Measures, which are the aggregations on the columns in the table.
      - name: order_total
        agg: sum
    dimensions: # Dimensions are either categorical or time. They add additional context to metrics and the typical querying pattern is Metric by Dimension.
      - name: metric_time
        expr: cast(ordered_at as date)
        type: time
        type_params:
          time_granularity: day
  - name: customers    # The name of the second semantic model
    description: >
      Customer dimension table. The grain of the table is one row per
        customer.
    model: ref('customers') #The name of the dbt model and schema
    defaults:
      agg_time_dimension: first_ordered_at
    entities: # Entities, which  usually correspond to keys in the table.
      - name: customer 
        type: primary
        expr: customer_id
    dimensions: # Dimensions are either categorical or time. They add additional context to metrics and the typical querying pattern is Metric by Dimension.
      - name: is_new_customer
        type: categorical
        expr: case when first_ordered_at is not null then true else false end
      - name: first_ordered_at
        type: time
        type_params:
          time_granularity: day

  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="example2" label="More dimensions example">

Similarly, you could then add additional dimensions like `is_food_order` to your semantic models to incorporate even more dimensions to slice and dice your revenue order_total. 

```yaml
semantic_models:
  - name: orders
    description: |
      A model containing order data. The grain of the table is the order id.
    model: ref('orders')  #The name of the dbt model and schema
    defaults:
      agg_time_dimension: metric_time
    entities: # Entities, which usually correspond to keys in the table
      - name: order_id
        type: primary
      - name: customer
        type: foreign
        expr: customer_id
    measures: # Measures, which are the aggregations on the columns in the table.
      - name: order_total
        agg: sum
    dimensions: # Dimensions are either categorical or time. They add additional context to metrics and the typical querying pattern is Metric by Dimension.
      - name: metric_time
        expr: cast(ordered_at as date)
        type: time
        type_params:
          time_granularity: day
      - name: is_food_order
        type: categorical
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="example3" label="Advanced example">

Imagine an even more complex metric is needed, like the amount of money earned each day from food orders from returning customers. Without MetricFlow the data practitioner's original SQL might look like this:

```sql
select
    date_trunc('day',orders.ordered_at) as day, 
    sum(case when is_food_order = true then order_total else null end) as food_order,
    sum(orders.order_total) as sum_order_total,
    food_order/sum_order_total
from
  orders
left join
  customers
on
  orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
where
  case when customers.first_ordered_at is not null then true else false end = true
group by 1
```

MetricFlow simplifies the SQL process via metric YAML configurations as seen below. You can also commit them to your git repository to ensure everyone on the data and business teams can see and approve them as the true and only source of information.

```yaml
metrics:
  - name: food_order_pct_of_order_total_returning
    description: Revenue from food orders from returning customers
    label: "Food % of Order Total"
    type: ratio
    type_params:
      numerator: food_order
      denominator: order_total
    filter: |
      {{ Dimension('customer__is_new_customer') }} = false
```

## FAQs

<DetailsToggle alt_header="Do my datasets need to be normalized?">

Not at all! While a cleaned and well-modeled data set can be extraordinarily powerful and is the ideal input, you can use any dataset from raw to fully denormalized datasets. 

It's recommended that you apply quality data consistency, such as filtering bad data, normalizing common objects, and data modeling of keys and tables, in upstream applications. The Semantic Layer is more efficient at doing data denormalization instead of normalization.

If you have not invested in data consistency, that is okay. The Semantic Layer can take SQL queries or expressions to define consistent datasets.

</DetailsToggle>

<DetailsToggle alt_header="Why is normalized data the ideal input?">

MetricFlow is built to do denormalization efficiently. There are better tools to take raw datasets and accomplish the various tasks required to build data consistency and organized data models. On the other end, by putting in denormalized data you are potentially creating redundancy which is technically challenging to manage, and you are reducing the potential granularity that MetricFlow can use to aggregate metrics.
</DetailsToggle>

<DetailsToggle alt_header="Why not just make metrics the same as measures?">
One principle of MetricFlow is to reduce the duplication of logic sometimes referred to as Don't Repeat Yourself(DRY).

Many metrics are constructed from reused measures and in some cases constructed from measures from different semantic models. This allows for metrics to be built breadth-first (metrics that can stand alone) instead of depth-first (where you have multiple metrics acting as functions of each other).

Additionally, not all metrics are constructed off of measures. As an example, a conversion metric is likely defined as the presence or absence of an event record after some other event record.

</DetailsToggle>
<DetailsToggle alt_header="How does the dbt Semantic Layer handle joins?">
The dbt Semantic Layer, powered by MetricFlow,  builds joins based on the types of keys and parameters that are passed to entities. To better understand how joins are constructed see our documentation on join types.

Rather than capturing arbitrary join logic, MetricFlow captures the types of each identifier and then helps the user to navigate to appropriate joins. This allows us to avoid the construction of fan out and chasm joins as well as generate legible SQL.
</DetailsToggle>

<DetailsToggle alt_header="Are entities and join keys the same thing?">
If it helps you to think of entities as join keys, that is very reasonable. Entities in MetricFlow have applications beyond joining two tables, such as acting as a dimension.
</DetailsToggle>

<DetailsToggle alt_header="Can a table without a primary or unique entities have dimensions?">
Yes, but because a dimension is considered an attribute of the primary or unique ent of the table, they are only usable by the metrics that are defined in that table. They cannot be joined to metrics from other tables. This is common in event logs.
</DetailsToggle>
