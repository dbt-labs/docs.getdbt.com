## Getting started with hooks and operations

Effective database administration sometimes requires additional SQL statements to be run, for example:
- Creating UDFs
- Managing row- or column-level permissions
- Vacuuming tables on Redshift
- Creating partitions in Redshift Spectrum external tables
- Resuming/pausing/resizing warehouses in Snowflake
- Refreshing a pipe in Snowflake
- Create a share on Snowflake
- Cloning a database on Snowflake

dbt provides hooks and operations so you can version control and execute these statements as part of your dbt project.

## About hooks

Hooks are snippets of SQL that are executed at different times:
  * `pre-hook`: executed _before_ a model, seed or snapshot is built.
  * `post-hook`: executed _after_ a model, seed or snapshot is built.
  * `on-run-start`: executed at the _start_ of `dbt run`, `dbt test`, `dbt seed` or `dbt snapshot`
  * `on-run-end`: executed at the _end_ of `dbt run`, `dbt test`, `dbt seed` or `dbt snapshot`

Hooks are a more-advanced capability that enable you to run custom SQL, and leverage database-specific actions, beyond what dbt makes available out-of-the-box with standard materializations and configurations.

<Snippet src="hooks-to-grants" />

<VersionBlock firstVersion="1.2">

If (and only if) you can't leverage the [`grants` resource-config](/reference/resource-configs/grants), you can use `post-hook` to perform more advanced workflows:

* Need to apply `grants` in a more complex way, which the dbt Core v1.2 `grants` config does not (yet) support.
* Need to perform post-processing that dbt does not support out-of-the-box. For example, `analyze table`, `alter table set property`, `alter table ... add row access policy`, etc.

### Examples using hooks

You can use hooks to trigger actions at certain times when running an operation or building a model, seed, or snapshot.

For more information about when hooks can be triggered, see reference sections for [`on-run-start` and `on-run-end` hooks](on-run-start-on-run-end) and [`pre-hook`s and `post-hook`s](pre-hook-post-hook).

You can use hooks to provide database-specific functionality not available out-of-the-box with dbt. For example, you can use a `config` block to run an `ALTER TABLE` statement right after building an individual model using a `post-hook`:

<File name='models/<model_name>.sql'>

```sql
{{ config(
    post_hook=[
      "alter table {{ this }} ..."
    ]
) }}
```

</File>


</VersionBlock>

### Examples using hooks

Here's a minimal example of using hooks to grant privileges. For more information, see [`on-run-start` & `on-run-end` hooks](on-run-start-on-run-end) and [`pre-hook` & `post-hook`](pre-hook-post-hook) reference sections.

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yml
on-run-end:
  - "grant usage on {{ target.schema }} to role reporter"

models:
  +post-hook:
    - "grant select on {{ this }} to role reporter"

```

</File>

You can also apply the `post-hook` to individual models using a `config` block:

<File name='models/<model_name>.sql'>

```sql
{{ config(
    post_hook=[
      "grant select on {{ this }} to role reporter"
    ]
) }}

select ...

```

</File>

You should use database-specific syntax when appropriate:

<WHCode>

<div warehouse="BigQuery">

<File name='models/<model_name>.sql'>

```sql
{{ config(
    post_hook=[
      'grant `roles/bigquery.dataViewer` on {{ this.type }} {{ this }} to "user:someone@yourcompany.com"'
    ]
) }}

select ...

```

</File>

</div>

<div warehouse="Databricks">

<File name='models/<model_name>.sql'>

```sql
{{ config(
    post_hook=[
      "grant select on {{ this }} to `someone@yourcompany.com`"
    ]
) }}

select ...

```

</File>

</div>

<div warehouse="Redshift">

<File name='models/<model_name>.sql'>

```sql
{{ config(
    post_hook=[
      "grant select on {{ this }} to reporter"
    ]
) }}

select ...

```

</File>

</div>

<div warehouse="Snowflake">

<File name='models/<model_name>.sql'>

```sql
{{ config(
    post_hook=[
      "grant select on {{ this }} to role reporter"
    ]
) }}

select ...

```

</File>

</div>

</WHCode>

</VersionBlock>

### Calling a macro in a hook

You can also use a [macro](jinja-macros#macros) to bundle up hook logic. Check out some of the examples in the reference sections for [on-run-start and on-run-end hooks](on-run-start-on-run-end) and [pre- and post-hooks](pre-hook-post-hook).

## About operations

Operations are [macros](jinja-macros#macros) that you can run using the [`run-operation`](run-operation) command. As such, operations aren't actually a separate resource in your dbt project â€” they are just a convenient way to invoke a macro without needing to run a model.

:::info Explicitly execute the SQL in an operation
Unlike hooks, you need to explicitly execute a query within a macro, by using either a [statement block](statement-blocks) or a helper macro like the [run_query](run_query) macro. Otherwise, dbt will return the query as a string without executing it.
:::

This macro performs a similar action as the above hooks:

<File name='macros/grant_select.sql'>

```sql
{% macro grant_select(role) %}
{% set sql %}
    grant usage on schema {{ target.schema }} to role {{ role }};
    grant select on all tables in schema {{ target.schema }} to role {{ role }};
    grant select on all views in schema {{ target.schema }} to role {{ role }};
{% endset %}

{% do run_query(sql) %}
{% do log("Privileges granted", info=True) %}
{% endmacro %}

```

</File>

To invoke this macro as an operation, execute `dbt run-operation grant_select --args '{role: reporter}'`.

```
$ dbt run-operation grant_select --args '{role: reporter}'
Running with dbt=0.16.1
Privileges granted

```

Full usage docs for the `run-operation` command can be found [here](run-operation).
