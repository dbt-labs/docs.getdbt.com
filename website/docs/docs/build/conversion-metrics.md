Conversion metrics allow you to define when a base event and a subsequent conversion event happen for a specific entity within some time range.

For example, using conversion metrics allows you to track how often a user (entity) completes a visit (base event) and then makes a purchase (conversion event) within 7 days (time window). You would need to add a time range and an entity to join. 

Conversion metrics are different from [ratio metrics](/docs/build/ratio) because you need to include an entity in the pre-aggregated join.

```

## Conversion metric example

The following example will measure conversions from website visits (`VISITS` table) to order completions (`BUYS` table) and calculate a conversion metric for this scenario step by step.

Suppose you have two semantic models, `VISITS` and `BUYS`:

- The `VISITS` table represents visits to an e-commerce site.
- The `BUYS` table represents someone completing an order on that site.  

The underlying tables look like the following:

`VISITS`<br />
Contains user visits with `USER_ID` and `REFERRER_ID`.

| DS | USER_ID | REFERRER_ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2020-01-01 | bob | facebook |
| 2020-01-04 | bob | google |
| 2020-01-07 | bob | amazon |

`BUYS`<br />
Records completed orders with `USER_ID` and `REFERRER_ID`.

| DS | USER_ID | REFERRER_ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2020-01-02 | bob | facebook |
| 2020-01-07 | bob | amazon |

Next, define a conversion metric as follows:

```yaml
- name: visit_to_buy_conversion_rate_7d
  description: "Conversion rate from visiting to transaction in 7 days"
  type: conversion
  label: Visit to Buy Conversion Rate (7-day window)
  type_params:
    conversion_type_params:
      base_measure:
        name: visits
        fill_nulls_with: 0
      conversion_measure: sellers
        name: sellers
      entity: user
      window: 7 days
```

To calculate the conversion, link the `BUYS` event to the nearest `VISITS` event (or closest base event). The following steps explain this process in more detail:

### Step 1: Join `VISITS` and `BUYS`

This step joins the `BUYS` table to the `VISITS` table and gets all combinations of visits-buys events that match the join condition where buys occur within 7 days of the visit (any rows that have the same user and a buy happened at most 7 days after the visit).

The SQL generated in these steps looks like the following:

```sql
select
  v.ds,
  v.user_id,
  v.referrer_id,
  b.ds,
  b.uuid,
  1 as buys
from visits v
inner join (
    select *, uuid_string() as uuid from buys -- Adds a uuid column to uniquely identify the different rows
) b
on
v.user_id = b.user_id and v.ds <= b.ds and v.ds > b.ds - interval '7 days'
```

The dataset returns the following (note that there are two potential conversion events for the first visit):

| V.DS | V.USER_ID | V.REFERRER_ID | B.DS | UUID | BUYS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2020-01-01 | bob | facebook | 2020-01-02 | uuid1 | 1 |
| 2020-01-01 | bob | facebook | 2020-01-07 | uuid2 | 1 |
| 2020-01-04 | bob | google | 2020-01-07 | uuid2 | 1 |
| 2020-01-07 | bob | amazon | 2020-01-07 | uuid2 | 1 |

### Step 2: Refine with window function

Instead of returning the raw visit values, use window functions to link conversions to the closest base event. You can partition by the conversion source and get the `first_value` ordered by `visit ds`, descending to get the closest base event from the conversion event:

```sql
select
  first_value(v.ds) over (partition by b.ds, b.user_id, b.uuid order by v.ds desc) as v_ds,
  first_value(v.user_id) over (partition by b.ds, b.user_id, b.uuid order by v.ds desc) as user_id,
  first_value(v.referrer_id) over (partition by b.ds, b.user_id, b.uuid order by v.ds desc) as referrer_id,
  b.ds,
  b.uuid,
  1 as buys
from visits v
inner join (
    select *, uuid_string() as uuid from buys
) b
on
v.user_id = b.user_id and v.ds <= b.ds and v.ds > b.ds - interval '7 day'
```

The dataset returns the following:

| V.DS | V.USER_ID | V.REFERRER_ID | B.DS | UUID | BUYS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2020-01-01 | bob | facebook | 2020-01-02 | uuid1 | 1 |
| 2020-01-07 | bob | amazon | 2020-01-07 | uuid2 | 1 |
| 2020-01-07 | bob | amazon | 2020-01-07 | uuid2 | 1 |
| 2020-01-07 | bob | amazon | 2020-01-07 | uuid2 | 1 |

This workflow links the two conversions to the correct visit events. Due to the join, you end up with multiple combinations, leading to fanout results. After applying the window function, duplicates appear. 

To resolve this and eliminate duplicates, use a distinct select. The UUID also helps identify which conversion is unique. The next steps provide more detail on how to do this.

### Step 3: Remove duplicates

Instead of regular select used in the [Step 2](#step-2-refine-with-window-function), use a distinct select to remove the duplicates:

```sql
select distinct
  first_value(v.ds) over (partition by b.ds, b.user_id, b.uuid order by v.ds desc) as v_ds,
  first_value(v.user_id) over (partition by b.ds, b.user_id, b.uuid order by v.ds desc) as user_id,
  first_value(v.referrer_id) over (partition by b.ds, b.user_id, b.uuid order by v.ds desc) as referrer_id,
  b.ds,
  b.uuid,
  1 as buys
from visits v
inner join (
    select *, uuid_string() as uuid from buys
) b
on
v.user_id = b.user_id and v.ds <= b.ds and v.ds > b.ds - interval '7 day';
```

The dataset returns the following:

| V.DS | V.USER_ID | V.REFERRER_ID | B.DS | UUID | BUYS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2020-01-01 | bob | facebook | 2020-01-02 | uuid1 | 1 |
| 2020-01-07 | bob | amazon | 2020-01-07 | uuid2 | 1 |

You now have a dataset where every conversion is connected to a visit event. To proceed:

1. Sum up the total conversions in the "conversions" table.
2. Combine this table with the "opportunities" table, matching them based on group keys.
3. Calculate the conversion rate.

### Step 4: Aggregate and calculate

Now that you’ve tied each conversion event to a visit, you can calculate the aggregated conversions and opportunities measures. Then, you can join them to calculate the actual conversion rate. The SQL to calculate the conversion rate is as follows:

```sql
select
  coalesce(subq_3.metric_time__day, subq_13.metric_time__day) as metric_time__day,
  cast(max(subq_13.buys) as double) / cast(nullif(max(subq_3.visits), 0) as double) as visit_to_buy_conversion_rate_7d
from ( -- base measure
  select
    metric_time__day,
    sum(visits) as mqls
  from (
    select
      date_trunc('day', first_contact_date) as metric_time__day,
      1 as visits
    from visits
  ) subq_2
  group by
    metric_time__day
) subq_3
full outer join ( -- conversion measure
  select
    metric_time__day,
    sum(buys) as sellers
  from (
    -- ...
    -- The output of this subquery is the table produced in Step 3. The SQL is hidden for legibility.
    -- To see the full SQL output, add --explain to your conversion metric query. 
  ) subq_10
  group by
    metric_time__day
) subq_13
on
  subq_3.metric_time__day = subq_13.metric_time__day
group by
  metric_time__day
```

### Additional settings

Use the following additional settings to customize your conversion metrics:

- **Null conversion values:** Set null conversions to zero using `fill_nulls_with`. Refer to [Fill null values for metrics](/docs/build/fill-nulls-advanced) for more info.
- **Calculation type:** Choose between showing raw conversions or conversion rate.
- **Constant property:** Add conditions for specific scenarios to join conversions on constant properties.

<TabItem value="null" label="Set null conversion events to zero">

To return zero in the final data set, you can set the value of a null conversion event to zero instead of null. You can add the `fill_nulls_with` parameter to your conversion metric definition like this:

```yaml
- name: visit_to_buy_conversion_rate_7_day_window
  description: "Conversion rate from viewing a page to making a purchase"
  type: conversion
  label: Visit to Seller Conversion Rate (7 day window)
  type_params:
    conversion_type_params:
      calculation: conversions
      base_measure:
        name: visits
      conversion_measure: 
        name: buys
        fill_nulls_with: 0
      entity: user
      window: 7 days 

```

This will return the following results:

Refer to [Fill null values for metrics](/docs/build/fill-nulls-advanced) for more info.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="calctype" label="Set calculation type parameter">

Use the conversion calculation parameter to either show the raw number of conversions or the conversion rate. The default value is the conversion rate.

You can change the default to display the number of conversions by setting the `calculation: conversion` parameter:

```yaml
- name: visit_to_buy_conversions_1_week_window
    description: "Visit to Buy Conversions"
    type: conversion
    label: Visit to Buy Conversions (1 week window)
    type_params:
      conversion_type_params:
        calculation: conversions
        base_measure:
          name: visits
        conversion_measure: 
          name: buys
          fill_nulls_with: 0
        entity: user
        window: 1 week
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="constproperty" label="Set constant property">

*Refer to [Amplitude's blog posts on constant properties](https://amplitude.com/blog/holding-constant) to learn about this concept.*

You can add a constant property to a conversion metric to count only those conversions where a specific dimension or entity matches in both the base and conversion events. 

For example, if you're at an e-commerce company and want to answer the following question:
- _How often did visitors convert from `View Item Details` to `Complete Purchase` with the same product in each step?_<br />
  - This question is tricky to answer because users could have completed these two conversion milestones across many products. For example, they may have viewed a pair of shoes, then a T-shirt, and eventually checked out with a bow tie. This would still count as a conversion, even though the conversion event only happened for the bow tie.

Back to the initial questions, you want to see how many customers viewed an item detail page and then completed a purchase for the _same_ product.

In this case, you want to set `product_id` as the constant property. You can specify this in the configs as follows:

```yaml
- name: view_item_detail_to_purchase_with_same_item
  description: "Conversion rate for users who viewed the item detail page and purchased the item"
  type: Conversion
  label: View Item Detail > Purchase
  type_params:
    conversion_type_params:
      calculation: conversions
      base_measure:
        name: view_item_detail 
      conversion_measure: purchase
      entity: user
      window: 1 week
      constant_properties:
        - base_property: product
          conversion_property: product
```

You will add an additional condition to the join to make sure the constant property is the same across conversions.

```sql
select distinct
  first_value(v.ds) over (partition by buy_source.ds, buy_source.user_id, buy_source.session_id order by v.ds desc rows between unbounded preceding and unbounded following) as ds,
  first_value(v.user_id) over (partition by buy_source.ds, buy_source.user_id, buy_source.session_id order by v.ds desc rows between unbounded preceding and unbounded following) as user_id,
  first_value(v.referrer_id) over (partition by buy_source.ds, buy_source.user_id, buy_source.session_id order by v.ds desc rows between unbounded preceding and unbounded following) as referrer_id,
  buy_source.uuid,
  1 as buys
from {{ source_schema }}.fct_view_item_details v
inner join
  (
    select *, {{ generate_random_uuid() }} as uuid from {{ source_schema }}.fct_purchases
  ) buy_source
on
  v.user_id = buy_source.user_id
  and v.ds <= buy_source.ds
  and v.ds > buy_source.ds - interval '7 day'
  and buy_source.product_id = v.product_id --Joining on the constant property product_id
```
