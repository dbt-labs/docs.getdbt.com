Dimensions represent the non-aggregatable columns in your data set, which are the attributes, features, or characteristics that describe or categorize data. In the context of the dbt Semantic Layer, dimensions are part of a larger structure called a semantic model. They are created along with other elements like [entities](/docs/build/entities) and [measures](/docs/build/measures) and used to add more details to your data. In SQL, dimensions are typically included in the `group by` clause of your SQL query.

<!--dimensions are non-aggregatable expressions that define the level of aggregation for a metric used to define how data is sliced or grouped in a metric. Since groups can't be aggregated, they're considered to be a property of the primary or unique entity of the table.

Groups are defined within semantic models, alongside entities and measures, and correspond to non-aggregatable columns in your dbt model that provides categorical or time-based context. In SQL, dimensions  is typically included in the GROUP BY clause.-->

All dimensions require a `name`, `type`, and can optionally include an `expr` parameter. The `name` for your Dimension must be unique within the same semantic model.

| Parameter | Description | Type |
| --------- | ----------- | ---- |
| `name` |  Refers to the name of the group that will be visible to the user in downstream tools. It can also serve as an alias if the column name or SQL query reference is different and provided in the `expr` parameter. <br /><br /> Dimension names should be unique within a semantic model, but they can be non-unique across different models as MetricFlow uses [joins](/docs/build/join-logic) to identify the right dimension. | Required |
| `type` | Specifies the type of group created in the semantic model. There are two types:<br /><br />- **Categorical**: Describe attributes or features like geography or sales region. <br />- **Time**: Time-based dimensions like timestamps or dates. | Required |
| `type_params` | Specific type params such as if the time is primary or used as a partition | Required |
| `description` | A clear description of the dimension | Optional |
| `expr` | Defines the underlying column or SQL query for a dimension. If no `expr` is specified, MetricFlow will use the column with the same name as the group. You can use the column name itself to input a SQL expression. | Optional |
| `label` | A recommended string that defines the display value in downstream tools. Accepts plain text, spaces, and quotes (such as `orders_total` or `"orders_total"`).  | Optional |

Refer to the following for the complete specification for dimensions:

```yaml
dimensions:
  - name: Name of the group that will be visible to the user in downstream tools # Required
    type: Categorical or Time # Required
    label: Recommended adding a string that defines the display value in downstream tools. # Optional
    type_params: Specific type params such as if the time is primary or used as a partition # Required
    description: Same as always # Optional
    expr: The column name or expression. If not provided the default is the dimension name # Optional
```

Refer to the following example to see how dimensions are used in a semantic model:

```yaml
semantic_models:
  - name: transactions
    description: A record for every transaction that takes place. Carts are considered multiple transactions for each SKU. 
    model: {{ ref('fact_transactions') }}
    defaults:
      agg_time_dimension: order_date
# --- entities --- 
  entities: 
    - name: transaction
      type: primary
      ...
# --- measures --- 
  measures: 
      ... 
# --- dimensions ---
  dimensions:
    - name: order_date
      type: time
      type_params:
        time_granularity: day
      label: "Date of transaction" # Recommend adding a label to provide more context to users consuming the data
      expr: ts
    - name: is_bulk
      type: categorical
      expr: case when quantity > 10 then true else false end
    - name: type
      type: categorical
```

Dimensions are bound to the primary entity of the semantic model they are defined in. For example the dimensoin `type` is defined in a model that has `transaction` as a primary entity. `type` is scoped to the `transaction` entity, and to reference this dimension you would use the fully qualified dimension name i.e `transaction__type`. 

MetricFlow requires that all semantic models have a primary entity. This is to guarantee unique dimension names. If your data source doesn't have a primary entity, you need to assign the entity a name using the `primary_entity` key. It doesn't necessarily have to map to a column in that table and assigning the name doesn't affect query generation. We recommend making these "virtual primary entities" unique across your semantic model. An example of defining a primary entity for a data source that doesn't have a primary entity column is below:

```yaml
semantic_model:
  name: bookings_monthly_source
  description: bookings_monthly_source
  defaults:
    agg_time_dimension: ds
  model: ref('bookings_monthly_source')
  measures:
    - name: bookings_monthly
      agg: sum
      create_metric: true
  primary_entity: booking_id
```

## Dimensions types
This section further explains the dimension definitions, along with examples. Dimensions have the following types:

- [Dimensions types](#dimensions-types)
- [Categorical](#categorical)
- [Time](#time)
  - [SCD Type II](#scd-type-ii)
    - [Basic structure](#basic-structure)
    - [Semantic model parameters and keys](#semantic-model-parameters-and-keys)
    - [Implementation](#implementation)
    - [SCD examples](#scd-examples)

## Categorical

Categorical dimensions are used to group metrics by different attributes, features, or characteristics such as product type. They can refer to existing columns in your dbt model or be calculated using a SQL expression with the `expr` parameter. An example of a categorical dimension is `is_bulk_transaction`, which is a group created by applying a case statement to the underlying column `quantity`. This allows users to group or filter the data based on bulk transactions.

```yaml
dimensions: 
  - name: is_bulk_transaction
    type: categorical
    expr: case when quantity > 10 then true else false end
```

## Time

Time has additional parameters specified under the `type_params` section. When you query one or more metrics, the default time dimension for each metric is the aggregation time dimension, which you can refer to as `metric_time` or use the dimension's name. 

You can use multiple time groups in separate metrics. For example, the `users_created` metric uses `created_at`, and the `users_deleted` metric uses `deleted_at`:

```bash
# dbt Cloud users
dbt sl query --metrics users_created,users_deleted --group-by metric_time__year --order-by metric_time__year

# dbt Core users
mf query --metrics users_created,users_deleted --group-by metric_time__year --order-by metric_time__year
```

You can set `is_partition` for time to define specific time spans. Additionally, use the `type_params` section to set `time_granularity` to adjust aggregation details (daily, weekly, and so on).

<Tabs queryString="dimension">

<TabItem value="is_partition" label="is_partition">

Use `is_partition: True` to show that a dimension exists over a specific time window. For example, a date-partitioned dimensional table. When you query metrics from different tables, the dbt Semantic Layer uses this parameter to ensure that the correct dimensional values are joined to measures. 

```yaml
dimensions: 
  - name: created_at
    type: time
    label: "Date of creation"
    expr: ts_created # ts_created is the underlying column name from the table 
    is_partition: True
    type_params:
      time_granularity: day
  - name: deleted_at
    type: time
    label: "Date of deletion"
    expr: ts_deleted # ts_deleted is the underlying column name from the table
    is_partition: True 
    type_params:
      time_granularity: day

measures:
  - name: users_deleted
    expr: 1
    agg: sum
    agg_time_dimension: deleted_at
  - name: users_created
    expr: 1
    agg: sum
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="time_gran" label="time_granularity">

<VersionBlock firstVersion="1.9">

`time_granularity` specifies the grain of a time dimension. MetricFlow will transform the underlying column to the specified granularity. For example, if you add hourly granularity to a time dimension column, MetricFlow will run a `date_trunc` function to convert the timestamp to hourly. You can easily change the time grain at query time and aggregate it to a coarser grain, for example, from hourly to monthly. However, you can't go from a coarser grain to a finer grain (monthly to hourly).

Our supported granularities are:
* nanosecond (Snowflake only)
* microsecond 
* millisecond
* second
* minute
* hour
* day
* week
* month
* quarter
* year

Aggregation between metrics with different granularities is possible, with the Semantic Layer returning results at the coarsest granularity by default. For example, when querying two metrics with daily and monthly granularity, the resulting aggregation will be at the monthly level.

```yaml
dimensions: 
  - name: created_at
    type: time
    label: "Date of creation"
    expr: ts_created # ts_created is the underlying column name from the table 
    is_partition: True 
    type_params:
      time_granularity: hour 
  - name: deleted_at
    type: time
    label: "Date of deletion"
    expr: ts_deleted # ts_deleted is the underlying column name from the table 
    is_partition: True 
    type_params:
      time_granularity: day 

measures:
  - name: users_deleted
    expr: 1
    agg: sum 
    agg_time_dimension: deleted_at
  - name: users_created
    expr: 1
    agg: sum
```

### SCD Type II

:::caution
Currently, semantic models with SCD Type II dimensions cannot contain measures.
:::

MetricFlow supports joins against dimensions values in a semantic model built on top of a slowly changing dimension (SCD) Type II table. This is useful when you need a particular metric sliced by a group that changes over time, such as the historical trends of sales by a customer's country.

#### Basic structure

SCD Type II are groups that change values at a coarser time granularity. SCD Type II tables typically have two time columns that indicate the validity period of a dimension: `valid_from` (or `tier_start`) and `valid_to` (or `tier_end`). This creates a range of valid rows with different dimension values for a metric or measure.

MetricFlow associates the metric with the earliest available dimension value within a coarser time window, such as a month. By default, it uses the group valid at the start of this time granularity.

MetricFlow supports the following basic structure of an SCD Type II data platform table:

| entity_key | dimensions_1 | dimensions_2 | ... | dimensions_x | valid_from | valid_to |
|------------|-------------|-------------|-----|-------------|------------|----------|  

* `entity_key` (required): A unique identifier for each row in the table, such as a primary key or another unique identifier specific to the entity.
* `valid_from`  (required): Start date timestamp for when the dimension is valid. Use `validity_params: is_start: True` in the semantic model to specify this.
* `valid_to`  (required): End date timestamp for when the dimension is valid. Use `validity_params: is_end: True` in the semantic model to specify this.

#### Semantic model parameters and keys
When configuring an SCD Type II table in a semantic model, use `validity_params` to specify the start (`valid_from`) and end (`valid_to`) of the validity window for each dimension. 

- `validity_params`: Parameters that define the validity window.
  - `is_start: True`: Indicates the start of the validity period. Displayed as `valid_from` in the SCD table.
  - `is_end: True`: Indicates the end of the validity period. Displayed as `valid_to` in the SCD table.

Here’s an example configuration:

```yaml
- name: tier_start #  The name of the dimension.
  type: time # The type of dimension (such as time)
  label: "Start date of tier" # A readable label for the dimension
  expr: start_date # Expression or column name the dimension represents
  type_params: # Additional parameters for the dimension type
    time_granularity: day # Specifies the granularity of the time dimension (such as day)
    validity_params: # Defines the validity window
      is_start: True # Indicates the start of the validity period. 
- name: tier_end 
  type: time
  label: "End date of tier"
  expr: end_date
  type_params:
    time_granularity: day
    validity_params:
      is_end: True # Indicates the end of the validity period.
```

SCD Type II tables have a specific dimension with a start and end date. To join tables:
- Set the additional [entity `type`](/docs/build/entities#entity-types) parameter to the `natural` key. 
- Use a `natural` key as an [entity `type`](/docs/build/entities#entity-types), which means you don't need a `primary` key.
- In most instances, SCD tables don't have a logically usable `primary` key because `natural` keys map to multiple rows.

#### Implementation

Here are some guidelines to follow when implementing SCD Type II tables:

- The SCD table must have `valid_to` and `valid_from` time dimensions, which are logical constructs.
- The `valid_from` and `valid_to` properties must be specified exactly once per SCD table configuration.
- The `valid_from` and `valid_to` properties shouldn't be used or specified on the same time dimension.
- The `valid_from` and `valid_to` time dimensions must cover a non-overlapping period where one row matches each natural key value (meaning they must not overlap and should be distinct).
- We recommend defining the underlying dbt model with [dbt snapshots](/docs/build/snapshots). This supports the SCD Type II table layout and ensures that the table is updated with the latest data.

This is an example of SQL code that shows how a sample metric called `num_events` is joined with versioned dimensions data (stored in a table called `scd_dimensions`) using a primary key made up of the `entity_key` and `timestamp` columns. 

```sql
select metric_time, dimensions_1, sum(1) as num_events
from events a
left outer join scd_dimensions b
on 
  a.entity_key = b.entity_key 
  and a.metric_time >= b.valid_from 
  and (a.metric_time < b. valid_to or b.valid_to is null)
group by 1, 2
```

#### SCD examples

The following are examples of how to use SCD Type II tables in a semantic model:

<Expandable alt_header="SCD dimensions for sales tiers and the time length of that tier.">

This example shows how to create slowly changing dimensions (SCD) using a semantic model. The SCD table contains information about salespersons' tier and the time length of that tier. Suppose you have the underlying SCD table:

| sales_person_id | tier | start_date | end_date | 
|-----------------|------|------------|----------|
| 111             | 1    | 2019-02-03 | 2020-01-05| 
| 111             | 2    | 2020-01-05 | 2048-01-01| 
| 222             | 2    | 2020-03-05 | 2048-01-01| 
| 333             | 2    | 2020-08-19 | 2021-10-22| 
| 333             | 3    | 2021-10-22 | 2048-01-01|  

As mentioned earlier, the `validity_params` include two important arguments that specify the columns in the SCD table that mark the start and end dates (or timestamps) for each tier or dimension:
- `is_start`
- `is_end`

Additionally, the entity is tagged as `natural` to differentiate it from a `primary` entity. In a `primary` entity, each entity value has one row. In contrast, a `natural` entity has one row for each combination of entity value and its validity period.

```yaml 
semantic_models:
  - name: sales_person_tiers
    description: SCD Type II table of tiers for salespeople 
    model: {{ ref('sales_person_tiers') }}
    defaults:
      agg_time_dimension: tier_start

    dimensions:
      - name: tier_start
        type: time
        label: "Start date of tier"
        expr: start_date
        type_params:
          time_granularity: day
          validity_params:
            is_start: True
      - name: tier_end 
        type: time
        label: "End date of tier"
        expr: end_date
        type_params:
          time_granularity: day
          validity_params:
            is_end: True
      - name: tier
        type: categorical

    primary_entity: sales_person

    entities:
      - name: sales_person
        type: natural 
        expr: sales_person_id
```

The following code represents a separate semantic model that holds a fact table for `transactions`:  

```yaml
semantic_models: 
  - name: transactions 
    description: |
      Each row represents one transaction.
      There is a transaction, product, sales_person, and customer id for 
      every transaction. There is only one transaction id per 
      transaction. The `metric_time` or date is reflected in UTC.
    model: {{ ref('fact_transactions') }}
    defaults:
      agg_time_dimension: metric_time

    entities:
      - name: transaction_id
        type: primary
      - name: customer
        type: foreign
        expr: customer_id
      - name: product
        type: foreign
        expr: product_id
      - name: sales_person
        type: foreign
        expr: sales_person_id

    measures:
      - name: transactions
        expr: 1
        agg: sum
      - name: gross_sales
        expr: sales_price
        agg: sum
      - name: sales_persons_with_a_sale
        expr: sales_person_id
        agg: count_distinct

    dimensions:
      - name: metric_time
        type: time
        label: "Date of transaction"
        is_partition: true
        type_params:
          time_granularity: day
      - name: sales_geo
        type: categorical
```

You can now access the metrics in the `transactions` semantic model organized by the slowly changing dimension of `tier`. 

In the sales tier example,  For instance, if a salesperson was Tier 1 from 2022-03-01 to 2022-03-12, and gets promoted to Tier 2 from 2022-03-12 onwards, all transactions from March would be categorized under Tier 1 since the dimensions value of Tier 1 comes earlier (and is the default starting point), even though the salesperson was promoted to Tier 2 on 2022-03-12.

<Expandable alt_header="SCD dimensions with sales tiers and group transactions by month when tiers are missing">

This example shows how to create slowly changing dimensions (SCD) using a semantic model. The SCD table contains information about salespersons' tier and the time length of that tier. Suppose you have the underlying SCD table:

| sales_person_id | tier | start_date | end_date | 
|-----------------|------|------------|----------|
| 111             | 1    | 2019-02-03 | 2020-01-05| 
| 111             | 2    | 2020-01-05 | 2048-01-01| 
| 222             | 2    | 2020-03-05 | 2048-01-01| 
| 333             | 2    | 2020-08-19 | 2021-10-22| 
| 333             | 3    | 2021-10-22 | 2048-01-01|  

In the sales tier example, if sales_person_id 456 is Tier 2 from 2022-03-08 onwards, but there is no associated tier level dimension for this person from 2022-03-01 to 2022-03-08, then all transactions associated with sales_person_id 456 for the month of March will be grouped under 'NA' since no tier is present prior to Tier 2.

The following command or code represents how to return the count of transactions generated by each sales tier per month:

```bash
# dbt Cloud users
dbt sl query --metrics transactions --group-by metric_time__month,sales_person__tier --order-by metric_time__month,sales_person__tier

# dbt Core users
mf query --metrics transactions --group-by metric_time__month,sales_person__tier --order-by metric_time__month,sales_person__tier

```
