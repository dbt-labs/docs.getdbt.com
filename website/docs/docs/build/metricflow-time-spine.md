MetricFlow uses a timespine table to construct cumulative metrics. By default, MetricFlow expects the timespine table to be named `metricflow_time_spine` and doesn't support using a different name.

To create this table, you need to create a model in your dbt project called `metricflow_time_spine` and add the following code:

<File name='metricflow_time_spine.sql'>

<VersionBlock lastVersion="1.6">

```sql
{{
    config(
        materialized = 'table',
    )
}}

with days as (

    {{
        dbt_utils.date_spine(
            'day',
            "to_date('01/01/2000','mm/dd/yyyy')",
            "to_date('01/01/2027','mm/dd/yyyy')"
        )
    }}

),

final as (
    select cast(date_day as date) as date_day
    from days
)

select * from final
```

</VersionBlock>

<VersionBlock firstVersion="1.7">

```sql
{{
    config(
        materialized = 'table',
    )
}}

with days as (

    {{
        dbt.date_spine(
            'day',
            "to_date('01/01/2000','mm/dd/yyyy')",
            "to_date('01/01/2027','mm/dd/yyyy')"
        )
    }}

),

final as (
    select cast(date_day as date) as date_day
    from days
)

select * from final
```

</VersionBlock>

You only need to include the `date_day` column in the table. MetricFlow can handle broader levels of detail, but it doesn't currently support finer grains.
