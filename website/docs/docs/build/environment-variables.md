Environment variables can be used to customize the behavior of a dbt project depending on where the project is running. See the docs on
[env_var](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/env_var) for more information on how to call the jinja function `{{env_var('DBT_KEY','OPTIONAL_DEFAULT')}}` in your project code.

:::info Environment Variable Naming and Prefixing
Environment variables in dbt Cloud must be prefixed with either `DBT_` or `DBT_ENV_SECRET_`. Environment variables keys are uppercased and case sensitive. When referencing `{{env_var('DBT_KEY')}}` in your project's code, the key must match exactly the variable defined in dbt Cloud's UI.

### Setting and overriding environment variables

**Order of precedence**

Environment variable values can be set in multiple places within dbt Cloud. As a result, dbt Cloud will interpret environment variables according to the following order of precedence (lowest to highest):

 <Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/Environment Variables/env-var-precdence.png" title="Environment variables order of precedence"/>

There are four levels of environment variables:
 1. the optional default argument supplied to the `env_var` Jinja function in code
 2. a project-wide default value, which can be overridden at
 3. the environment level, which can in turn be overridden again at
 4. the job level (job override) or in the IDE for an individual dev (personal override).


**Setting environment variables at the project and environment level**

To set environment variables at the project and environment level, click **Deploy** in the top left, then select **Environments**.  Click **Environments Variables** to add and update your environment variables.

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/Environment Variables/navigate-to-env-vars.gif" title="Environment variables tab"/>



You'll notice there is a `Project Default` column. This is a great place to set a value that will persist across your whole project, independent of where the code is run. We recommend setting this value when you want to supply a catch-all default or add a project-wide token or secret.

To the right of the `Project Default` column are all your environments. Values set at the environment level take priority over the project level default value. This is where you can tell dbt Cloud to interpret an environment value differently in your Staging vs. Production environment, as example.

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/Environment Variables/project-environment-view.png" title="Setting project level and environment level values"/>



**Overriding environment variables at the job level**

You may have multiple jobs that run in the same environment, and you'd like the environment variable to be interpreted differently depending on the job.

When setting up or editing a job, you will see a section where you can override environment variable values defined at the environment or project level.

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/Environment Variables/job-override.gif" title="Navigating to environment variables job override settings"/>


Every job runs in a specific, deployment environment, and by default, a job will inherit the values set at the environment level (or the highest precedence level set) for the environment in which it runs. If you'd like to set a different value at the job level, edit the value to override it.

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/Environment Variables/job-override.png" title="Setting a job override value"/>


**Overriding environment variables at the personal level**


You can also set a personal value override for an environment variable when you develop in the dbt integrated developer environment (IDE). By default, dbt Cloud uses environment variable values set in the project's development environment. To see and override these values, click the gear icon in the top right. Under "Your Profile," click **Credentials** and select your project. Click **Edit** and make any changes in "Environment Variables."

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/Environment Variables/personal-override.gif" title="Navigating to environment variables personal override settings"/>

To supply an override, developers can edit and specify a different value to use. These values will be respected in the IDE both for the Results and Compiled SQL tabs.

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/Environment Variables/personal-override.png" title="Setting a personal override value"/>

:::info Appropriate coverage
If you have not set a project level default value for every environment variable, it may be possible that dbt Cloud does not know how to interpret the value of an environment variable in all contexts. In such cases, dbt will throw a compilation error: "Env var required but not provided".
:::

:::info Changing environment variables mid-session in the IDE
If you change the value of an environment variable mid-session while using the IDE, you may have to refresh the IDE for the change to take effect.
:::

To refresh the IDE mid-development, click on either the green 'ready' signal or the red 'compilation error' message at the bottom right corner of the IDE. A new modal will pop up, and you should select the Refresh IDE button. This will load your environment variables values into your development environment.

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/Environment Variables/refresh-ide.gif" title="Refreshing IDE mid-session"/>

There are some known issues with partial parsing of a project and changing environment variables mid-session in the IDE. If you find that your dbt project is not compiling to the values you've set, try deleting the `target/partial_parse.msgpack` file in your dbt project which will force dbt to re-compile your whole project.

### Handling secrets

While all environment variables are encrypted at rest in dbt Cloud, dbt Cloud has additional capabilities for managing environment variables with secret or otherwise sensitive values. If you want a particular environment variable to be scrubbed from all logs and error messages, in addition to obfuscating the value in the UI, you can prefix the key with `DBT_ENV_SECRET_`. This functionality is supported from `dbt v1.0` and on.


<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/Environment Variables/DBT_ENV_SECRET.png" title="DBT_ENV_SECRET prefix obfuscation"/>

**Note**: An environment variable can be used to store a [git token for repo cloning](/docs/build/environment-variables#clone-private-packages). We recommend you make the git token's permissions read only and consider using a machine account or service user's PAT with limited repo access in order to practice good security hygiene.

### Special environment variables

dbt Cloud has a number of pre-defined variables built in. The following environment variables are set automatically for deployment runs, and their values cannot be changed.

**dbt Cloud context**
- `DBT_ENV`: This key is reserved for the dbt Cloud application and will always resolve to 'prod'

**Run details**
- `DBT_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID`: The ID of the dbt Cloud Project for this run
- `DBT_CLOUD_JOB_ID`: The ID of the dbt Cloud Job for this run
- `DBT_CLOUD_RUN_ID`: The ID of this particular run
- `DBT_CLOUD_RUN_REASON_CATEGORY`: The "category" of the trigger for this run (one of: `scheduled`, `github_pull_request`, `gitlab_merge_request`, `azure_pull_request`, `other`)
- `DBT_CLOUD_RUN_REASON`: The specific trigger for this run (eg. `Scheduled`, `Kicked off by <email>`, or custom via `API`)

**Git details**

_Note: These variables are currently only available for GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps
PR builds triggered via a webhook_

- `DBT_CLOUD_PR_ID`: The Pull Request ID in the connected version control system
- `DBT_CLOUD_GIT_SHA`: The git commit SHA which is being run for this Pull Request build


### Example usage

Environment variables can be used in many ways, and they give you the power and flexibility to do what you want to do more easily in dbt Cloud.

#### Clone private packages
Now that you can set secrets as environment variables, you can pass git tokens into your package HTTPS URLs to allow for on-the-fly cloning of private repositories. Read more about enabling [private package cloning](/docs/build/packages#private-packages).

#### Dynamically set your warehouse in your Snowflake connection
Environment variables make it possible to dynamically change the Snowflake virtual warehouse size depending on the job. Instead of calling the warehouse name directly in your project connection, you can reference an environment variable which will get set to a specific virtual warehouse at runtime. 

For example, suppose you'd like to run a full-refresh job in an XL warehouse, but your incremental job only needs to run in a medium-sized warehouse. Both jobs are configured in the same dbt Cloud environment. In your connection configuration, you can use an environment variable to set the warehouse name to `{{env_var('DBT_WAREHOUSE')}}`. Then in the job settings, you can set a different value for the `DBT_WAREHOUSE` environment variable depending on the job's workload.

Currently, it's not possible to dynamically set environment variables across models within a single run. This is because each env_var can only have a single set value for the entire duration of the run.

**Note** &mdash; You can also use this method with Databricks SQL Warehouse.

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/Environment Variables/warehouse-override.png" title="Adding environment variables to your connection credentials"/>

:::info Environment variables and Snowflake OAuth limitations
Env vars works fine with username/password and keypair, including scheduled jobs, because dbt Core consumes the Jinja inserted into the autogenerated `profiles.yml` and resolves it to do an `env_var` lookup. 

However, there are some limitations when using env vars with Snowflake OAuth Connection settings:

- You can't use them in the account/host field, but they can be used for database, warehouse, and role. 

Something to note, if you supply an environment variable in the account/host field, Snowflake OAuth Connection will **fail** to connect. This happens because the field doesn't pass through Jinja rendering, so dbt Cloud simply passes the literal `env_var` code into a URL string like `{{ env_var("DBT_ACCOUNT_HOST_NAME") }}.snowflakecomputing.com`, which is an invalid hostname.
:::

#### Audit your run metadata
Here's another motivating example that uses the dbt Cloud run ID, which is set automatically at each run. This additional data field can be used for auditing and debugging:

```sql

{{ config(materialized='incremental', unique_key='user_id') }}

with users_aggregated as (

    select
        user_id,
        min(event_time) as first_event_time,
        max(event_time) as last_event_time,
        count(*) as count_total_events

    from {{ ref('users') }}
    group by 1

)

select *,
    -- Inject the run id if present, otherwise use "manual"
    '{{ env_var("DBT_CLOUD_RUN_ID", "manual") }}' as _audit_run_id

from users_aggregated
```
