import ConfigMetric from '/snippets/_sl-configure-metricflow.md';
import TestQuery from '/snippets/_sl-test-and-query-metrics.md';

This getting started page presents a sample workflow to help you create your first metrics. It uses the [Jaffle shop example project](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle-sl-template) as the project data source and is available for you to use. If you prefer, you can create semantic models and metrics for your own dbt project.

To fully experience the power of a universal dbt Semantic Layer, take the following steps:

- [Create a semantic model](#create-a-semantic-model) with MetricFlow
- [Define metrics](#define-metrics) with MetricFlow
- [Test and query metrics](#test-and-query-metrics) with MetricFlow
- [Run a production job](#run-a-production-job) in dbt Cloud
- [Set up dbt Semantic Layer](#set-up-dbt-semantic-layer) in dbt Cloud
- [Connect to and query the API](#connect-and-query-api) with dbt Cloud

## Prerequisites

- Have an understanding of key concepts in [MetricFlow](/docs/build/about-metricflow), which powers the revamped dbt Semantic Layer.
- Have both your production and development environments running dbt version 1.6 or higher. Refer to [upgrade in dbt Cloud](/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-core-in-cloud) for more info.
- Use Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, or Redshift data platform
- A successful run in the environment where your Semantic Layer is configured
- To query with dbt Cloud:
  * Have a dbt Cloud Team or Enterprise [multi-tenant](/docs/cloud/about-cloud/regions-ip-addresses) deployment, hosted in North America (Other regions coming soon)
  * Set up the [dbt Semantic Layer](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/dbt-sl) and the [Semantic Layer API](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-api-overview) in the integrated tool to import metric definitions.
- To query locally:
  * dbt Core or Developer accounts must manually install the [MetricFlow CLI](/docs/build/metricflow-cli) to test or query their metrics. After installing the package, make sure you run at least one model. <br />

## Install MetricFlow

<InstallMetricFlow />

## Create a semantic model

<CreateModel />

## Define metrics

<DefineMetrics />

## Configure the MetricFlow time spine model

<ConfigMetric />

## Test and query metrics

<TestQuery />

## Run a production job

Before you begin, you must have a dbt Cloud Team or Enterprise [multi-tenant](/docs/cloud/about-cloud/regions-ip-addresses) deployment, hosted in North America.

Once you’ve defined metrics in your dbt project, you can perform a job run in your dbt Cloud deployment environment to materialize your metrics. Only the deployment environment is supported for the dbt Semantic Layer at this moment. 

1. Go to **Deploy** in the menu bar
2. Select **Jobs** to re-run the job with the most recent code in the deployment environment.
3. Your metric should appear as a red node in the dbt Cloud IDE and dbt directed acyclic graphs (DAG).

## Set up dbt Semantic Layer

import SlSetUp from '/snippets/_new-sl-setup.md';  

<SlSetUp/>

## Connect and query API

You must have a dbt Cloud Team or Enterprise [multi-tenant](/docs/cloud/about-cloud/regions-ip-addresses) deployment, hosted in North America. You can query your metrics in a JDBC-enabled tool or use existing first-class integrations with the dbt Semantic Layer.

To connect and query your metrics using the dbt Semantic Layer and its API:

1. <span>Refer to the  <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-api-overview" target="_self">{frontMatter.meta.api_name}</a></span> to learn how to integrate with the JDBC. 
2. Once you've connected to the API, you should then set up and query metrics in your downstream tool of choice.

Refer to [Available integrations](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/avail-sl-integrations) for more info.

## FAQs

If you're encountering some issues when defining your metrics or setting up the dbt Semantic Layer, check out a list of answers to some of the questions or problems you may be experiencing.

  <summary>How do I migrate from the legacy Semantic Layer to the new one?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>If you're using the legacy Semantic Layer, we highly recommend you <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-core-in-cloud">upgrade your dbt version </a> to dbt v1.6 or higher to use the new dbt Semantic Layer. Refer to the dedicated <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/migration/sl-migration"> migration guide</a> for more info.</div>

<details>
<summary>How are you storing my data?</summary>
User data passes through the Semantic Layer on its way back from the warehouse. dbt Labs ensures security by authenticating through the customer's data warehouse. Currently, we don't cache data for the long term, but it might temporarily stay in the system for up to 10 minutes, usually less. In the future, we'll introduce a caching feature that allows us to cache data on our infrastructure for up to 24 hours.

<details>
<summary>Is the dbt Semantic Layer open source?</summary>
The dbt Semantic Layer is proprietary, however, some components of the dbt Semantic Layer are open source, like dbt-core and MetricFlow. <br /><br />The universal dbt Semantic Layer is available to all Team and Enterprise Plans during public beta. Users on dbt Cloud Developer plans or dbt Core users can use MetricFlow to only define and test metrics locally.</details>
