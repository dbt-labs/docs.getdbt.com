## Overview

dbt's notion of `models` makes it easy for data teams to version control and collaborate on data transformations. Sometimes though, a certain sql statement doesn't quite fit into the mold of a dbt model. These more "analytical" sql files can be versioned inside of your dbt project using the `analysis` functionality of dbt.

Any `.sql` files found in the `analyses/` directory of a dbt project will be compiled, but not executed. This means that analysts can use dbt functionality like `{{ ref(...) }}` to select from models in an environment-agnostic way.

In practice, an analysis file might look like this (via the [open source Quickbooks models](https://github.com/dbt-labs/quickbooks)):

<File name='analyses/running_total_by_account.sql'>

```sql
-- analyses/running_total_by_account.sql

with journal_entries as (

  select *
  from {{ ref('quickbooks_adjusted_journal_entries') }}

), accounts as (

  select *
  from {{ ref('quickbooks_accounts_transformed') }}

)

select
  txn_date,
  account_id,
  adjusted_amount,
  description,
  account_name,
  sum(adjusted_amount) over (partition by account_id order by id rows unbounded preceding)
from journal_entries
order by account_id, id
```

</File>

To compile this analysis into runnable sql, run:
```
dbt compile
```

Then, look for the compiled SQL file in `target/compiled/{project name}/analyses/running_total_by_account.sql`. This sql can then be pasted into a data visualization tool, for instance. Note that no `running_total_by_account` relation will be materialized in the database as this is an `analysis`, not a `model`.
