Simple metrics are metrics that directly reference a single measure, without any additional measures involved.
<!-- create_metric not supported yet
:::tip

If you've already defined the measure using the `create_metric: true` parameter, you don't need to create simple metrics. However, if you want to include a filter or in the final metric, you'll need to define and create a simple metric.

``` yaml
metrics: 
  - name: cancellations
    type: simple # Pointers to a measure you created in a data source
    type_params:
      measure: cancellations_usd # The measure you're creating a proxy of.
  # For any metric optionally include a filter string which applies a dimensional filter when computing the metric
      filter: | 
      {{dimension('value')}} > 100 and {{dimension('acquisition', entity_path=['user'])}}
```
