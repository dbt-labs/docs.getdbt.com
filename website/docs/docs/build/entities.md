Entities are real-world concepts in a business such as customers, transactions, and ad campaigns. We often focus our analyses around specific entities, such as customer churn or annual recurring revenue modeling. We represent entities in our semantic models using id columns that serve as join keys to other semantic models in your semantic graph.

Within a semantic graph, the required parameters for an entity are `name` and `type`. The `name` refers to either the key column name from the underlying data table, or it may serve as an alias with the column name referenced in the `expr` parameter.

Entities can be specified with a single column or multiple columns. Entities (join keys) in a semantic model are identified by theirÂ name. Each entity name must be unique within a semantic model, but it doesn't have to be unique across different semantic models. 

There are four entity types: primary, foreign, unique, or natural.

:::tip Use entities as a dimensions
You can also use entities as a dimensions, which allows you to aggregate a metric to the granularity of that entity.

## Entity types

MetricFlow's join logic depends on the entity `type` you use, and it also determines how to join semantic models. Refer to [Joins](/docs/build/join-logic) for more info on how to construct joins.

* **Primary &mdash;** A primary key has **only one** record for each row in the table, and it includes every record in the data platform.
* **Unique &mdash;** A unique key contains **only one** record per row in the table, but it may have a subset of records in the data warehouse. It can also include nulls.
* **Foreign &mdash;** A foreign key can include zero, one, or multiple instances of the same record. Null values may also be present.
* **Natural &mdash;** Natural keys are column or combination of columns in a table that uniquely identify a record based on real-world data. For instance, in a sales_person_department dimension table, the sales_person_id can serve as a natural key.

The complete spec for entities is below:
```yaml
entities:
  - name: transaction     ## Required
    type: primary or natural or foreign or unique ## Required
    description: a description of the field or role the entity takes in this table ## Optional
    expr: the field that denotes that entity (transaction_id).  ## Optional
          If not specified will default to name 

```

Here's an example of how to define entities in a semantic model:

``` yaml
entities:
  - name: transaction
    type: primary
    expr: id_transaction
  - name: order
    type: foreign
    expr: id_order
  - name: user
    type: foreign
    expr: substring(id_order from 2)
```
