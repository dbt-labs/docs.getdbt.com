Saved queries are a way to save commonly used queries in MetricFlow. You can group metrics, dimensions, and filters that are logically related into a saved query. 

To define a saved query, refer to the following specification:

 Parameter | Description | Type |
| --------- | ----------- | ---- |
| `name` | The name of the metric. | Required |
| `description` | The description of the metric. | Optional |
| `query_params` | The query parameters for the saved query: `metrics`, `group_by`, and `where`. | Required |

The following is an example of a saved query:

```yaml
saved_queries:
  - name: p0_booking
    description: Booking-related metrics that are of the highest priority.
    query_params:
      metrics:
        - bookings
        - instant_bookings
      group_by:
        - TimeDimension('metric_time', 'day')
        - Dimension('listing__capacity_latest')
      where:
        - "{{ Dimension('listing__capacity_latest') }} > 3"
```

All metrics in a saved query need to use the same dimensions in the `group_by` or `where` clauses.
