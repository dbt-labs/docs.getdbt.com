Use MetricFlow in dbt to centrally define your metrics. As a key component of the [dbt Semantic Layer](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/dbt-sl), MetricFlow is responsible for SQL query construction and defining specifications for dbt semantic models and metrics. It uses familiar constructs like semantic models and metrics to avoid duplicative coding, optimize your development workflow, ensure data governance for company metrics, and guarantee consistency for data consumers.

MetricFlow allows you to:
- Intuitively define metrics in your dbt project
- Develop from your preferred environment, whether that's the [dbt Cloud CLI](/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation), [dbt Cloud IDE](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud), or [dbt Core](/docs/core/installation-overview)
- Use [MetricFlow commands](/docs/build/metricflow-commands) to query and test those metrics in your development environment 
- Harness the true magic of the universal dbt Semantic Layer and dynamically query these metrics in downstream tools (Available for dbt Cloud [Team or Enterprise](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing/) accounts only).
