Use MetricFlow in dbt to centrally define your metrics. As a key component of the [dbt Semantic Layer](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/dbt-sl), MetricFlow is responsible for SQL query construction and defining specifications for dbt semantic models and metrics.

Use familiar constructs like semantic models and metrics to avoid duplicative coding, optimize your development workflow, ensure data governance for company metrics, and guarantee consistency for data consumers.

:::info
MetricFlow is currently available on dbt v1.6 or higher. MetricFlow provides a new way to define metrics in dbt and replaces the dbt_metrics package.

To use the dbt Semantic Layer, you must have a [dbt Cloud Team or Enterprise account](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing/).
:::

Before you start, consider the following guidelines:

- Define metrics in YAML and query them using these [new metric specifications](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/discussions/7456).
- You must be on dbt v1.6 or higher to use MetricFlow. [Upgrade your dbt Cloud version](/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-core-in-cloud) to get started.
- Use MetricFlow with Snowflake, Postgres, BigQuery, Databricks, or Redshift.
- Unlock insights and query your metrics using the [dbt Semantic Layer](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/dbt-sl) and its diverse range of [available integrations](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/avail-sl-integrations).
