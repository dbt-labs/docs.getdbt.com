title: How do I preserve leading zeros in a seed?
---

If you need to preserve leading zeros (for example in a zipcode or mobile number):

1. v0.16.0 onwards: Include leading zeros in your seed file, and use the `column_types` [configuration](reference/resource-configs/column_types.md) with a varchar datatype of the correct length.
2. Prior to v0.16.0: Use a downstream model to pad the leading zeros using SQL, for example: `lpad(zipcode, 5, '0')`
