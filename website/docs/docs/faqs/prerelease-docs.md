title: Why are there "prerelease" docs?
---
We want to give beta testers the information they need to try out new features, without adding confusion to the current docs site. This is served from a long-lived `next` branch of the docs repo. Feedback on prerelease docs is also welcomeâ€”use the "Edit this page" feature at the bottom.
