title: What is the difference between dbt Core, the dbt CLI and dbt Cloud?
---

dbt Core is the software that takes a [dbt project](projects) (`.sql` and `.yml` files) and a command and then creates tables/views in your warehouse. dbt Core includes a command line interface (CLI) so that users can execute dbt commands using a terminal program. dbt Core is [open source](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt) and free to use.

dbt Cloud is an application that helps teams use dbt. dbt Cloud provides a web-based IDE to develop dbt projects, a purpose-built scheduler, and a way to share dbt documentation with your team. dbt Cloud offers a number of features for free, as well as additional features in paid tiers (check out the pricing [here](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing/)).
