title: What parts of Jinja are dbt-specific?
---

There are certain expressions that are specific to dbt — these are documented in the [Jinja function reference](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions) section of these docs. Further, docs blocks, snapshots, and <Term id="materialization">materializations</Term> are custom Jinja _blocks_ that exist only in dbt.
