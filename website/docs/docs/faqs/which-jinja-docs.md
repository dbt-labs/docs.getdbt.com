title: Which docs should I use when writing Jinja or creating a macro?
---

If you are stuck with a Jinja issue, it can get confusing where to check for more information. We recommend you check (in order):

1. [Jinja's Template Designer Docs](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/page/templates/): This is the best reference for most of the Jinja you'll use
2. [Our Jinja function reference](dbt-jinja-functions): This documents any additional functionality we've added to Jinja in dbt.
3. [Agate's table docs](https://agate.readthedocs.io/page/api/table.html): If you're operating on the result of a query, dbt will pass it back to you as an agate table. This means that the methods you call on the <Term id="table" /> belong to the Agate library rather than Jinja or dbt.
