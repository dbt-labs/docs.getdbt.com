### Severity level for Enterprise support

Support tickets are assigned a severity level based on the impact of the issue on your business. The severity level is assigned by dbt Labs, and the level assigned determines the priority level of support you will receive. For specific ticket response time or other questions that relate to your Enterprise account’s SLA, please refer to your Enterprise contract.

| Severity Level | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Severity Level 1 | Any Error which makes the use or continued use of the Subscription or material features impossible; Subscription is not operational, with no alternative available. | 
| Severity Level 2 | Feature failure, without a workaround, but Subscription is operational. | 
| Severity Level 3 | Feature failure, but a workaround exists. | 
| Severity Level 4 | Error with low-to-no impact on Client’s access to or use of the Subscription, or Client has a general question or feature enhancement request. |
