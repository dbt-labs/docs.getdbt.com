dbt Labs often beta tests features before deciding to continue on the [Product lifecycle](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/product-lifecycles#dbt-cloud).

You can access experimental features if you want to preview beta features that haven’t yet been released to dbt Cloud. You can toggle on or off all experimental beta features in one place. As with other beta features, these features:

- May not be feature-complete or fully stable as we’re actively developing them.
- Could be discontinued at any time.
- May require feedback from you to understand their limitations or impact. Each experimental feature collects feedback directly in dbt Cloud.
- May have limited technical support and be excluded from our Support SLAs.
- May not have public documentation available.

To enable or disable experimental features:

1. Navigate to Your Profile settings by clicking the gear icon in the top right.
2. Find Experimental features at the bottom of the page.
3. Click **Beta** to toggle the features on or off as shown in the following image.
