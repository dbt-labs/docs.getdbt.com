# Upgrading to dbt utils v1.0

For the first time, [dbt utils](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/dbt_utils/latest/) is crossing the major version boundary. From [last month’s blog post](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/announcing-dbt-v1.3-and-utils/): 

> It’s time to formalize what was already unofficial policy: you can rely on dbt utils in the same way as you do dbt Core, with stable interfaces and consistent and intuitive naming.

Just like the switch to dbt Core 1.0 last year, there are some breaking changes as we standardized and prepared for the future. Most changes can be handled with find-and-replace. If you need help, post on the [Community Forum](https://discourse.getdbt.com) or in [#package-ecosystem](https://getdbt.slack.com/archives/CU4MRJ7QB) channel on Slack. 

## New features

- `get_single_value()` &mdash; An easy way to pull a single value from a SQL query, instead of having to access the `[0][0]`th element of a `run_query` result.
- `safe_divide()` &mdash; Returns null when the denominator is 0, instead of throwing a divide-by-zero error.
- New `not_empty_string` test &mdash; An easier wrapper than using `expression_is_true` to check the length of a column.

## Enhancements

- Many tests are more meaningful when you run them against subgroups of a table. For example, you may need to validate that recent data exists for every turnstile instead of a single data source being sufficient. Add the new `group_by_columns` argument to your tests to do so. Review [this article](https://www.emilyriederer.com/post/grouping-data-quality/) by the test's author for more information.
- With the addition of an on-by-default `quote_identifiers` argument in the `star()` macro, you can now disable quoting if necessary.
- The `recency` test now has an optional `ignore_time_component` argument which can be used when testing against a date column. This prevents the time of day the test runs from causing false negatives/positives.

## Fixes

- `union()` now includes/excludes columns case-insensitively
- `slugify()` prefixes an underscore when the first char is a digit
- The `expression_is_true` test doesn’t output `*` unless storing failures, a cost improvement for BigQuery.

## Breaking Changes
### Changes to `surrogate_key()`:

- `surrogate_key()` has been replaced by `generate_surrogate_key()`. The original treated null values and blank strings the same, which could lead to duplicate keys being created.  `generate_surrogate_key()` does not have this flaw. Compare the [surrogate keys calculated for these columns](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qWfdbieUOSgkzdY0kmJ9iCgdqyWccA0R-6EW0EgaMQc/edit#gid=0):

![A table comparing the behavior of surrogate_key and generate_surrogate_key](/img/guides/migration/versions/surrogate_key_behaviour.png)

Changing the calculation method for surrogate keys, even for the better, could have significant consequences in downstream uses (such as snapshots and incremental models which use this column as their `unique_key`). As a result, it's possible to opt into the legacy behavior by setting the following variable in your dbt project:

```yaml
#dbt_project.yml
vars:
  surrogate_key_treat_nulls_as_empty_strings: true #turn on legacy behavior
```

By creating a new macro instead of updating the behavior of the old one, we are requiring all projects who use this macro to make an explicit decision about which approach is better for their context. 

**Our recommendation is that existing users should opt into the legacy behavior** unless you are confident that either:

- your surrogate keys never contained nulls, or 
- your surrogate keys are not used for incremental models, snapshots or other stateful artifacts and so can be regenerated with new values without issue.

:::caution Warning to package maintainers

You can not assume one behavior or the other, as each project can customize its behavior.

### Functionality now native to dbt Core:
- The `expression_is_true` test no longer has a dedicated `condition` argument. Instead, use `where` which is [now available natively to all tests](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/where):

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: old_syntax
    tests:
      - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
          expression: "col_a + col_b = total"
          #replace this...
          condition: "created_at > '2018-12-31'" 

  - name: new_syntax
    tests:
      - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
          expression: "col_a + col_b = total"
          # ...with this...
          where: "created_at > '2018-12-31'"
```
**Note** &mdash; This may cause some tests to get the same autogenerated names. To resolve this, you can [define a custom name for a test](/reference/resource-properties/data-tests#define-a-custom-name-for-one-test).
- The deprecated `unique_where` and `not_null_where` tests have been removed, because [where is now available natively to all tests](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/where). To migrate, find and replace `dbt_utils.unique_where` with `unique` and `dbt_utils.not_null_where` with `not_null`.
- `dbt_utils.current_timestamp()` is replaced by `dbt.current_timestamp()`. 
  - Note that Postgres and Snowflake’s implementation of `dbt.current_timestamp()` differs from the old `dbt_utils` one ([full details here](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils/pull/597#issuecomment-1231074577)). If you use Postgres or Snowflake and need identical backwards-compatible behavior, use `dbt.current_timestamp_backcompat()`. This discrepancy will hopefully be reconciled in a future version of dbt Core.
- All other cross-db macros have moved to the dbt namespace, with no changes necessary other than replacing `dbt_utils.` with `dbt.`. Review the [cross database macros documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/cross-database-macros) for the full list.
    - In your code editor, you can do a global find and replace with regex: `\{\{\s*dbt_utils\.(any_value|bool_or|cast_bool_to_text|concat|dateadd|datediff|date_trunc|escape_single_quotes|except|hash|intersect|last_day|length|listagg|position|replace|right|safe_cast|split_part|string_literal|type_bigint|type_float|type_int|type_numeric|type_string|type_timestamp|type_bigint|type_float|type_int|type_numeric|type_string|type_timestamp|except|intersect|concat|hash|length|position|replace|right|split_part|escape_single_quotes|string_literal|any_value|bool_or|listagg|cast_bool_to_text|safe_cast|dateadd|datediff|date_trunc|last_day)` → `{{ dbt.$1`
### Removal of `insert_by_period` materialization
- The `insert_by_period` materialization has been moved to the [experimental-features repo](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-labs-experimental-features/tree/main/insert_by_period). To continue to use it, add the below to your packages.yml file:

```yaml
packages:
  - git: https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-labs-experimental-features
    subdirectory: insert_by_period
    revision: XXXX #optional but highly recommended. Provide a full git sha hash, e.g. 1c0bfacc49551b2e67d8579cf8ed459d68546e00. If not provided, uses the current HEAD.
```
### Removal of deprecated legacy behavior:
- `safe_add()` only works with a list of arguments; use `{{ dbt_utils.safe_add(['column_1', 'column_2']) }}` instead of varargs `{{ dbt_utils.safe_add('column_1', 'column_2') }}`.
- Several long-promised deprecations to `deduplicate()` have been applied:
    - The `group_by` argument is replaced by `partition_by`.
    - `relation_alias` is removed. If you need an alias, you can pass it directly to the `relation` argument.
    - `order_by` is now mandatory. Pass a static value like `1` if you don’t care how they are deduplicated.
- The deprecated `table` argument has been removed from `unpivot()`. Use `relation` instead.


## Resolving error messages
After upgrading, these are common error messages you may encounter, along with their resolutions.
<details>
	<summary><code>dict object has no attribute MACRO_NAME</code></summary>
	<div>
		<p><b>Cause</b>: No macro called <code>MACRO_NAME</code> exists. This is most likely because the macro has moved to the <code>dbt</code> namespace (see above). It could also be because you haven't run dbt deps or have misspelled a macro's name.</p>
