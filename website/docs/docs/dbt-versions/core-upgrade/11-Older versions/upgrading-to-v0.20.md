### Resources

- [Discourse](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/2621)
- [Release notes](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/releases/tag/v0.20.0)
- [Full changelog](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/0.20.latest/CHANGELOG.md)

## Breaking changes

- Schema test macros are now `test` blocks, which we're going to start calling "generic tests." There is backwards compatibility for schema test macros prefixed `test_`, and you can still use them without switching to test blocks (though we hope you will soon!). The biggest breaking change is that _all_ tests now return a set of failing rows, rather than a single numeric value. This resolved a longstanding inconsistency between schema tests and data tests.
- **For package maintainers (and some users):** The syntax for `adapter.dispatch()` has changed; see linked documentation below.
- **For adapter plugin maintainers:** Macro dispatch now includes "parent" adapter implementations before using the default implementation. If you maintain an adapter plugin that inherits from another adapter (e.g. `dbt-redshift` inherits from `dbt-postgres`), `adapter.dispatch()` will now look for prefixed macros in the following order: `redshift__`, `postgres__`, `default__`.
- **For artifact users:** The [manifest](/reference/artifacts/manifest-json) and [run_results](/reference/artifacts/run-results-json) now use a v2 schema. What changed: there are a handful of new properties in the manifest; the number of failures for a test has been moved to a new property `failures`, so that `message` can be the human-readable failure message.

## New and changed documentation

### Tests

- [Building a dbt Project: tests](/docs/build/data-tests)
- [Test Configs](/reference/data-test-configs)
- [Test properties](/reference/resource-properties/data-tests)
- [Node Selection](/reference/node-selection/syntax) (with updated [test selection examples](/reference/node-selection/test-selection-examples))
- [Writing custom generic tests](/best-practices/writing-custom-generic-tests)

### Elsewhere in Core
- [Parsing](/reference/parsing): rework of partial parsing, introduction of experimental parser
- The [graph](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/graph) Jinja context variable includes `exposures`
- [Packages](/docs/build/packages) can now be installed from git with a specific commit hash as the revision, or via sparse checkout if the dbt project is located in a `subdirectory`.
- [adapter.dispatch](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/dispatch) supports new arguments, a new [project-level config](/reference/project-configs/dispatch-config), and includes parent adapters when searching for macro implementations.
- [Exposures](/reference/exposure-properties) support `tags` and `meta` properties

### Plugins
- New partition-related [BigQuery configs](/reference/resource-configs/bigquery-configs#additional-partition-configs): `require_partition_filter` and `partition_expiration_days`
- On BigQuery, dbt can now add [query comment](/reference/project-configs/query-comment) items as job labels
- Snowflake and BigQuery [incremental models](/docs/build/incremental-strategy#strategy-specific-configs) using the `merge` strategy accept a new optional config, `merge_update_columns`.
- [Postgres configs](/reference/resource-configs/postgres-configs) now include first-class support for `indexes`
