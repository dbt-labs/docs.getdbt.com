Cross-database queries for RA3 instances are now supported by dbt Cloud projects using a Redshift connection. 

With cross-database queries, you can seamlessly query data from any database in the cluster, regardless of which database you are connected to with dbt. 

The [connection configuration](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-profiles/redshift-profile) `ra3_node` has been defaulted to `true`. This allows users to:

- benefit from the full RA3 nodesâ€™ capabilities, 
- generate appropriate dbt documentation.
