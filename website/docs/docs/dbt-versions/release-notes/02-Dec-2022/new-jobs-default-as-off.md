To help save compute time, new jobs will no longer be triggered to run by default. When you create a new job in dbt Cloud, you can trigger the job to run by selecting **Run on schedule** and completing the desired schedule and timing information.

For more information, refer to [Job triggers](/docs/deploy/job-triggers).
