Hello from the dbt Docs team: @mirnawong1, @matthewshaver, @nghi-ly, and @runleonarun! First, we’d like to thank the 10 new community contributors to docs.getdbt.com :pray: What a busy start to the year! We merged 110 PRs in January.

Here's how we improved the [docs.getdbt.com](http://docs.getdbt.com/) experience:

- Added new hover behavior for images and FAQs. This was subsequently modified to improve user experience.
- Pruned outdated notices and snippets as part of the docs site maintenance
