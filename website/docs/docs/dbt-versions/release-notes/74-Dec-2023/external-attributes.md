The extended attributes feature in dbt Cloud is now GA! It allows for an environment level override on any YAML attribute that a dbt adapter accepts in its `profiles.yml`. You can provide a YAML snippet to add or replace any [profile](/docs/core/connect-data-platform/profiles.yml) value.

To learn more, refer to [Extended attributes](/docs/dbt-cloud-environments#extended-attributes).

The **Extended Atrributes** text box is available from your environment's settings page:
