On Oct 16, 2023, a Public Preview of dbt Explorer will become available to dbt Cloud customers. With dbt Explorer, you can view your project's resources (such as models, tests, and metrics) and their lineage &mdash; including interactive DAGs &mdash; to gain a better understanding of its latest production state. Navigate and manage your projects within dbt Cloud to help you and other data developers, analysts, and consumers discover and leverage your dbt resources.

For details, refer to [Explore your dbt projects](/docs/collaborate/explore-projects).
