Welcome to the 2021 changelog for the dbt Cloud application! You can use this changelog to see highlights of what was new, fixed, and enhanced.

## dbt Cloud v1.1.41 (December 8, 2021)

It's one of the best weeks of the year - it's [Coalesce](https://coalesce.getdbt.com/)! We'll have some exciting product announcements to share! Did somebody say [metrics](https://coalesce.getdbt.com/talks/keynote-metric-system/) and [dbt Core v1.0](https://coalesce.getdbt.com/talks/dbt-v10-reveal/)?!

#### New products and features

- dbt v1.0 is now available in dbt Cloud... nbd.


#### Performance improvements and enhancements

- Now whenever you log back into dbt Cloud, you'll return to the account and project that you most recently were working in!


## dbt Cloud v1.1.39 (November 10, 2021)
We shipped environment variables in dbt Cloud. Environment variables create a way to separate code from configuration - allowing you to set config based on context and keep secrets like git tokens securely stored.

#### New products and features
- You can now add environment variables to your dbt Cloud project. Why does this matter? Environment variables are a fundamental building block of a dbt project, which until now, we only enabled in dbt Core. They power many use cases such as cloning private packages, limiting the amount of data that is processed in development environments, changing your data sources depending on the environment, and more. Read about environment variables in our [blog post](https://blog.getdbt.com/introducing-environment-variables-in-dbt-cloud/) or [docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/cloud-environment-variables).


## dbt Cloud v1.1.38 (October 27, 2021)
Have you used the [Metadata API](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/metadata-api) yet? The Metadata API is available to customers on the Team and Enterprise plans, and with it, you can learn tons about your dbt project, if it's running dbt v0.19.0 or later. You can now query information about _any_ run, not just the last run of a job. Mo' data, mo' fun!


## dbt Cloud v1.1.37 (October 13, 2021)
dbt v0.21 is now available in dbt Cloud. The big change with this release is it introduces the `dbt build` command. `dbt build` logically does everything you'd want to do in your DAG. It runs your models, tests your tests, snapshots your snapshots, and seeds your seeds. It does this, resource by resource, from left to right across your DAG. dbt build is an opinionated task. It’s the culmination of all we’ve built- running models with resilient <Term id="materialization">materializations</Term>, prioritizing data quality with tests, updating fixtures with seeds, capturing slowly changing dimensions with snapshot. Give it a try!

#### New products and features
- We have a new beta feature, which we're calling Model Bottlenecks. It allows you to visually see how long it takes to build models in each run, so you can see clearly which models are taking the longest. If you're interested in learning more, check out #beta-feedback-model-bottlenecks in the dbt community Slack, and we can add you to the beta.

## dbt Cloud v1.1.36 (September 29, 2021)
Check out the release candidate for `dbt v0.21.0`! Also tab switching in the dbt Cloud IDE now keeps track of your scroll position - at last!

#### Bug fixes
- Some Redshift customers were experiencing timeouts on runs. We've since fixed this bug by keeping the session alive longer.

#### Performance improvements and enhancements
- You won't lose track of the code snippets you were looking at when you switch back and forth between tabs in the dbt Cloud IDE, as we now keep track of your scroll position.

## dbt Cloud v1.1.35 (September 15, 2021)
Have you ever been working in the IDE, taken a several hour break from developing, and when you returned to your work, the IDE started behaving in unexpected ways? Your develop session became inactive, without any notification. Well, that silent failure won’t happen anymore! dbt Cloud now will let you know when you have to refresh your IDE so you can continue to pick up work where you last left off.

#### New products and features
- dbt v0.20.2 is released in dbt Cloud.

#### Performance improvements and enhancements
- Set default threads to 4 for new jobs and in development creds.

#### Bug fixes
- The user is now prompted to refresh the page when in a disconnected IDE state.
- dbt tasks that fail or error are now correctly ordered in the run drawer history.


## dbt Cloud v1.1.34 (September 1, 2021)
We just launched our beta for supporting environment variables in dbt Cloud. Environment variables are exciting because they allow you to clone private packages. If you’re interested in joining the beta, check out the #beta-feedback-for-env-vars channel in dbt Slack for more information.

#### Performance improvements and enhancements
Our IDE SQL drawer got a fresh new look, and it now has improved accessibility.


## dbt Cloud v1.1.33 (August 18, 2021)
We added a DAG in the IDE, so that you can see your model dependencies as you develop! If you haven’t seen the DAG visualization yet, take a moment to spin up the IDE, navigate to the Lineage tab, and click-click-click around in there — it is legitimately a brand new modality for developing dbt projects, and it’s something worth being excited about!

#### New products and features
- [Dashboard Status Tiles](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/cloud-dashboard-status-tiles) can now be embedded on dashboards (or anywhere you can embed an iFrame) to give immediate insight into data freshness and quality. This helps dbt project maintainers build trust internally about the data that end users are seeing.
- We shipped DAG in the IDE to GA!
- Support for `dbt v0.20.1` in Cloud.

#### Bug fixes
- Databricks users will now be able to see and update the token/schema for deployment environments.
- Some Github users were experiencing a broken profile image in dbt Cloud. This should be fixed if users disconnect and reconnect their Github accounts.


## dbt Cloud v1.1.32 (August 4, 2021)
The Metadata API is now in GA! When dbt Cloud invokes certain commands like run, test, seed, etc, dbt generates metadata in the form of [artifacts](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/dbt-artifacts). These artifacts give you tons of information about project set up, run times, test details, compiled SQL, and so much more. Now dbt Cloud serves a GraphQL API which supports arbitrary queries over these artifacts, so you can retrieve the metadata you want almost instantaneously.

#### New products and features
- The Metadata API is the start of our metadata product suite. Learn more about how to use the Metadata API [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/metadata-api).
- dbt Enterprise customers using GitHub now get better <Term id="grain">fine-grained</Term> access control in their dbt projects. dbt will enforce git permissions for every developer to ensure that read / write policies in GitHub carry through to the IDE.


## dbt Cloud v1.1.31 (July 21, 2021)
We’ve improved the tabbing experience in the IDE. Tabs now work much more intuitively, and you don’t have to worry about losing your work anymore!

#### New products and features
- We are working to release a DAG directly in the IDE, so that when you’re developing, you have a clear idea of where the model you’re working on sits in the dependency graph. If you’re interested in testing out the feature early, head over to the `#beta-feedback-for-ide-dag` channel in the dbt Slack, and we’ll get the new product feature-flagged on your account!
- Added dbt 0.20.0 to Cloud

#### Bug fixes
- Users will now be able to initialize any project that doesn't contain a `dbt_project.yml` file, regardless of whether or not there are pre-existing files and/or commits to that repo.

#### Performance improvements and enhancements
- We've been working on some nice improvements to tabs in our IDE. We’ve fixed deficiencies with tabs that caused users to lose work if they didn’t hit save regularly enough. Additionally, opening, closing, and the order of the tabs work much more smoothly.
- You may have noticed that there is now a source freshness checkbox in your execution settings when you configure a job on dbt Cloud. Selecting this checkbox will run `dbt source freshness` as the first step in your job, but it will not break subsequent steps if it fails. Updated source freshness documentation available [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/cloud-snapshotting-source-freshness).
- Added a new endpoint to allow API key rotation via `POST https://cloud.getdbt.com/api/v2/users/{user-id}/apiKey`


## dbt Cloud v1.1.30 (July 7, 2021)
We shipped a resizable folder pane in the IDE, and we're hearing great things! "My quality of life has greatly increased with this little update!" Hope this helps everyone else enjoy the IDE a little more too.

#### New products and features
- Resizable folder pane in the IDE: Have you ever developed in the IDE and not been able to see the full name of your model because you couldn’t adjust the width of the file pane? Yeah, us too. Now you’ll be able to adjust your project’s file tree width to be as wide or as narrow as you’d like. It’s these small things that make developing in the IDE so much easier.

#### Bug fixes
- Made some changes to GitLab webhooks so that the status of the dbt run gets properly updated in GitLab.
- Resolved an issue where users saw a blank screen rather than the SSO reauthentication page.

#### Performance improvements and enhancements
- Refreshed the design of the repository import page.


## dbt Cloud v1.1.29 (June 23, 2021)
We're heads down working on a handful of new features that we're going to share at the end of this month. The finish line is in sight. In the meantime, check out our latest release candidates for dbt Core. The biggest changes are better tests, providing consistency, configurability, and persistence. Additionally, we've refactored partial parsing and introduced an experimental parser; both are set to off by default.

#### New products and features
- Add support for latest Core release candidates to dbt Cloud: v0.19.2-rc2 and v0.20.0-rc1

#### Bug fixes
- Add a safeguard for the SSO reauth page to avoid 401 interceptors

#### Performance improvements and enhancements
- Ensure navigation bar is in dark mode when IDE is set to dark mode


## dbt Cloud v1.1.28 (June 9, 2021)
We shipped a far better experience for GitLab users. Be sure to check out new CI features that are now available for customers using GitLab. Additionally, all developers should test out Slim CI which will speed up their model builds.

#### New products and features

- `Slim CI`: We’ve made Slim CI available for all our cloud customers! With Slim CI, you don't have to rebuild and test all your models; you can instruct dbt Cloud to run jobs on only modified or new resources. If you are a GitHub or GitLab user, try creating a new job that runs on pull requests and you can signal to dbt to run only on these modified resources by including the `state:modified+` argument. Read more about Slim CI [here](/docs/deploy/cloud-ci-job).

- Native GitLab authentication for dbt Cloud Developer and Team Tiers: We’ve shipped native GitLab auth into GA. You can now import new GitLab repos with a couple clicks, trigger CI builds when Merge Requests are opened in GitLab, and carry GitLab permissions through to dbt Cloud IDE's git actions. Read how to set up native GitLab auth [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/connecting-gitlab).

#### Bug fixes
- Allow users to select artifacts from a job that runs source freshness on jobs with the source freshness execution settings set to `ON`.
- Resolve `RUN ONLY ON CUSTOM BRANCH?` button to toggle on and off properly.
- Retain information in a `Statement` tab when the page is refreshed.
- Unsaved changes in the IDE are now saved when committing work.
- Drop temporary schemas in the data warehouse for closed or merged GitLab merge requests.

#### Performance improvements and enhancements
- Behind the scenes, we’ve been moving off of Angular and onto React. We’ve started the process of migrating the central pieces of our UI over - the first of which is the main navigation. We think this will have a big impact on our ability to reduce UI bugs and improve user experience.
- Added support for dbt 0.19.2rc2 + 0.20.0rc1 in dbt Cloud.


## dbt Cloud v1.1.27 (May 26, 2021)
