dbt Cloud now requires dbt version 1.0 or later. As of March 1, 2023, we removed all instances of older dbt versions from dbt Cloud. 
  
Any environments or jobs configured with a dbt version lower than 1.0 were automatically updated to dbt v1.4, which is the latest minor version available on dbt Cloud.
