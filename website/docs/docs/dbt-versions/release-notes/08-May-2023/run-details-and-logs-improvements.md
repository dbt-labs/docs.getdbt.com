New usability and design improvements to the run details and logs in dbt Cloud are now available. The ability to triage errors in logs is a big benefit of using dbt Cloud's job and scheduler functionality. These updates help make the process of finding the root cause much easier.

Highlights include:

- Surfacing a warn state on a run step
- Search in logs
- Easier discoverability of errors and warnings in logs
- Lazy loading of logs, making the whole run details page load faster and feel more performant
- Cleaner look and feel with iconography
- Helpful tool tips
