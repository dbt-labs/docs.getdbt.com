To continue improving your [Cloud IDE](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud) development experience, the dbt Labs team continues to work on adding new features, fixing bugs, and increasing reliability ✨.

Stay up-to-date with [IDE-related changes](/tags/ide).

## New features 
- Lint via SQL Fluff is now available in beta (GA over the next 2-3 weeks)
- Format markdown files with prettier
- Leverage developer experience shortcuts, including ``Ctrl + ` `` (toggle history drawer), `CMD + Option + /` (toggle block comment), `CMD + Shift + P` (open command palette), `Option + W` (close editor tab)
- Display parent folder name for files with same name in Changes section
- Navigate the new IDE features quickly using [the IDE User Interface](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/ide-user-interface) help page
- Use `top X` in SQL when previewing in the IDE
- Opt into the new IDE backend layer over the past month (still with dbt-rpc). Ready for beta later in June!


## Product refinements 

- Performance-related upgrades:
    - Reduced cold start time by 60+%
    - Improved render time of modals in the IDE by 98%
    - Improved IDE performance with dbt Core v1.5+ (faster and snappier – highly encourage you to [upgrade your dbt version](/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-core-in-cloud)!)
