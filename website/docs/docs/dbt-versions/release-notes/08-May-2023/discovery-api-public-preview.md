Users of the Discovery API can now query the latest state of their environment, meaning there's no need to consolidate results across jobs or artifact files. The environment essentially represents the latest production state of a dbt project. The new `environment` endpoint is in public preview and can be used with the existing `modelByEnvironment` endpoint for historical analysis. For details, refer to these docs:
