dbt Labs updated the docs for the [dbt Cloud Administrative API](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/admin-cloud-api) and they are now available for both [v2](/dbt-cloud/api-v2#/) and [v3](/dbt-cloud/api-v3#/). 

- Now using Spotlight for improved UI and UX.
- All endpoints are now documented for v2 and v3. Added automation to the docs so they remain up to date.  
- Documented many of the request and response bodies.
- You can now test endpoints directly from within the API docs. And, you can choose which [regional server](/docs/cloud/about-cloud/access-regions-ip-addresses) to use (North America, APAC, or EMEA).
- With the new UI, you can more easily generate code for any endpoint.
