You can now select **Render Lineage** to visualize large DAGs. 

Large DAGs can take a long time (10 or more seconds, if not minutes) to render and can cause browsers to crash. 

The new button prevents large DAGs from rendering automatically. Instead, you can select **Render Lineage** to load the visualization. This should affect about 15% of the DAGs.
