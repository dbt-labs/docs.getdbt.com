To continue improving your [Cloud IDE](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/develop-in-the-cloud) development experience, the dbt Labs team continue to work on adding new features, fixing bugs, and increasing reliability âœ¨.

Read more about the [upcoming improvements to the Cloud IDE](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/improvements-to-the-dbt-cloud-ide/) and stay up-to-date with [IDE-related changes](https://docs.getdbt.com/tags/ide).

## New features 

* New warning message suggests you invoke `dbt deps` when it's needed (as informed by `dbt-score`).
* New warning message appears when you select models but don't save them before clicking **Build** or invoking dbt (like, dbt build/run/test). 
* Previews of Markdown and CSV files are now available in the IDE console.
* The file tree menu now includes a Duplicate File option.
* Display loading time when previewing a model

## Product refinements 

* Enhance autocomplete experience which has performed slowly for people with large projects and who implement a limit to max `manifest.json` for this feature
* Introduce pagination for invocation node summary view (displaying 100 nodes at a time)
* Improve rendering for the Changes / Version Control section of the IDE
* Update icons to be consistent in dbt Cloud
* Add table support to the Markdown preview
* Add the lineage tab back to seed resources in the IDE
* Implement modal priority when there are multiple warning modals
* Improve a complex command's description in the command palette

## Bug fixes

* File tree no longer collapses on first click when there's a project subdirectory defined
* **Revert all** button now works as expected
* CSV preview no longer fails with only one column
* Cursor and scroll bar location are now persistent with their positions
* `git diff` view now shows just change diffs and no longer shows full diff (as if file is new) until page refreshes
* ToggleMinimap Command no longer runs another Command at the same time
* `git diff` view no longer shows infinite spins in specific scenarios (new file, etc.)
* File contents no longer get mixed up when using diff view and one file has unsaved changes
* YML lineage now renders model without tests (in dbt Core v1.5 and above)
* Radio buttons for **Summary** and **Details** in the logs section now consistently update to show the accurate tab selection
* IDE no longer throws the console error `Error: Illegal argument` and redirects to the `Something went wrong` page
