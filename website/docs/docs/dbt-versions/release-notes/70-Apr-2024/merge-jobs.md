# New: Merge jobs <Lifecycle status="beta" />

You can now set up a continuous deployment (CD) workflow for your projects natively in dbt Cloud. You can now access a beta release of [Merge jobs](/docs/deploy/merge-jobs), which is a new [job type](/docs/deploy/jobs), that enables you to trigger dbt job runs as soon as changes (via Git pull requests) merge into production.
