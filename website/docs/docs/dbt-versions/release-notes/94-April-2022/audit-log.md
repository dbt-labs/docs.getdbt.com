To review actions performed by people in your organization, dbt provides logs of audited user and system events. The dbt Cloud audit log lists events triggered in your organization within the last 90 days. 

The audit log includes details such as who performed the action, what the action was, and when it was performed. For more details, review [the audit log for dbt Cloud Enterprise](/docs/cloud/manage-access/audit-log) documentation.
