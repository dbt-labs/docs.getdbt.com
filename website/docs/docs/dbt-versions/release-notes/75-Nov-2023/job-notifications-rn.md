There are new quality-of-life improvements in dbt Cloud for email and Slack notifications about your jobs: 

- You can add external email addresses and send job notifications to them. External emails can be:
    - Addresses that are outside of your dbt Cloud account
    - Third-party integration addresses for configuring notifications to services like Microsoft Teams or PagerDuty 
- You can configure notifications for multiple Slack channels. Previously, you could only configure one Slack channel. 
- Any account admin can now edit slack notifications, not just the person who created them.
