dbt Labs is excited to announce the latest features and UI updates to dbt Explorer!

For more details, refer to [Explore your dbt projects](/docs/collaborate/explore-projects).

## The project's lineage graph 

- The search bar in the full lineage graph is now more prominent. 
- It's easier to navigate across projects using the breadcrumbs.
- The new context menu (right click) makes it easier to focus on a node or to view its lineage.

## Search improvements 

- When searching with keywords, a new side panel UI helps you filter search results by resource type, tag, column, and other key properties (instead of manually defining selectors). 
- Search result logic is clearly explained. For instance, indicating whether a resource contains a column name (exact match only).
