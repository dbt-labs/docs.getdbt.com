You can now use the `--no-partial-parse` flag to disable partial parsing in your dbt Cloud job commands. 

Previously, the [`--no-partial-parse` global config](/reference/global-configs/parsing) was only available in dbt Core. For more information, refer to [partial parsing](/reference/parsing#partial-parsing).
