You can now enable partial parsing in dbt Cloud run step commands. Previously, the [`--no-partial-parse` global config](/reference/global-configs#partial-parsing) was only available in dbt Core. For more information on partial parsing, refer to [partial parsing](/reference/parsing#partial-parsing).
