dbt Labs is introducing the newest connection option in dbt Cloud: the `dbt-trino` adapter is now available in Public Preview. This allows you to connect to Starburst Galaxy, Starburst Enterprise, and self-hosted Trino from dbt Cloud.

Check out our [Quickstart for dbt Cloud and Starburst Galaxy](/guides/starburst-galaxy) to explore more. 

## What’s the reason users should be excited about this?

By using Starburst or Trino as your data platform in dbt Cloud, you can now seamlessly transform data that's distributed across multiple sources, including object storage, data lakes, and data warehouses, with no data movement required.

The seamless integration means you can now get up and running within minutes.
