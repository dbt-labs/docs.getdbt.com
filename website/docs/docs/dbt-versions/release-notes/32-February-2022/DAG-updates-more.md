Love the DAG in the IDE as much as we do? Now when you click on a node in the DAG, the model or config file will open as a new tab in the IDE, so you can directly view or edit the code. We'll continue to ship better developer ergonomic functionality throughout the year.

#### Performance improvements and enhancements

* Updated recommended dbt commands in the IDE to include dbt Core v1.0 commands, such as "build" and the "--select" argument.
