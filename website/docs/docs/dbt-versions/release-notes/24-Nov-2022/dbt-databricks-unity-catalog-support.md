dbt Cloud is the easiest and most reliable way to develop and deploy a dbt project. It helps remove complexity while also giving you more features and better performance. A simpler Databricks connection experience with support for Databricks’ Unity Catalog and better modeling defaults is now available for your use.

For all the Databricks customers already using dbt Cloud with the dbt-spark adapter, you can now [migrate](/guides/migrate-from-spark-to-databricks) your connection to the [dbt-databricks adapter](/reference/warehouse-setups/databricks-setup) to get the benefits. [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/11/17/introducing-native-high-performance-integration-dbt-cloud.html) is committed to maintaining and improving the adapter, so this integrated experience will continue to provide the best of dbt and Databricks.
