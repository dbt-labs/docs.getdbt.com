The supported method for cloning private GitHub packages is the [git token method](/docs/build/packages#git-token-method), where an appropriate access token is passed into the package repository URL with an environment variable. 

A small number of people have been able to clone private packages using dbt's native GitHub application without explicitly providing an access token. This functionality is being deprecated as itâ€™s limited in flexibility. 

If you have been using a package hosted in a private repository on GitHub, you must start passing an access token into the URL. 

An example of passing an access token:

<File name='packages.yml'>

```yaml

packages:
- git: "https://{{env_var('DBT_ENV_SECRET_GIT_CREDENTIAL')}}@github.com/dbt-labs/awesome_repo.git"

```

</File>
