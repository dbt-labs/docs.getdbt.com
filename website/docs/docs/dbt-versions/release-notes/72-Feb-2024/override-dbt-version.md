You can now [override the dbt version](/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-dbt-version-in-cloud#override-dbt-version) that's configured for the development environment within your project and use a different version &mdash; affecting only your user account. This lets you test new dbt features without impacting other people working on the same project. And when you're satisfied with the test results, you can safely upgrade the dbt version for your project(s).  

Use the **dbt version** dropdown to specify the version to override with. It's available on your project's credentials page in the **User development settings** section. For example:
