# New: Keep on latest version <Lifecycle status='beta' />

_Now available in the dbt version dropdown in dbt Cloud &mdash; starting with select customers, rolling out to wider avaiability through February and March._

When the new **Keep on latest version** setting is enabled, you always get the latest fixes and early access to new functionality for your dbt project. dbt Labs will handle upgrades behind-the-scenes, as part of testing and redeploying the dbt Cloud application &mdash; just like other dbt Cloud capabilities and other SaaS tools that you're using. No more manual upgrades and no more need for _a second sandbox project_. 

To learn more about the new setting, refer to [Keep on latest version](/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-dbt-version-in-cloud#keep-on-latest-version) for details.
