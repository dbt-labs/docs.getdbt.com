Some noteworthy improvements include autocomplete snippets for sql and YAML files in the IDE, which are available for use now! We also added a [new metric layer page](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/cloud-metrics-layer) to docs.getdbt.com to help you begin thinking about the metrics layer in dbt Cloud.

#### Performance improvements and enhancements

* Branch names now default to "main" instead of "master" in new managed and unmanaged Git repositories.
* Update IDE autocomplete snippets.
