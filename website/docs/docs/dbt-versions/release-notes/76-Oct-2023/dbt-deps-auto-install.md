The dbt Cloud IDE and dbt Cloud CLI now automatically installs `dbt deps` when your environment starts or when necessary. Previously, it would prompt you to run `dbt deps` during initialization. 

This improved workflow is available to all multi-tenant dbt Cloud users (Single-tenant support coming next week) and applies to dbt versions.

However, you should still run the `dbt deps` command in these situations:

- When you make changes to the `packages.yml` or `dependencies.yml` file during a session
- When you update the package version in the `packages.yml` or `dependencies.yml` file. 
- If you edit the `dependencies.yml` file and the number of packages remains the same, run `dbt deps`. (Note that this is a known bug dbt Labs will fix in the future.)
