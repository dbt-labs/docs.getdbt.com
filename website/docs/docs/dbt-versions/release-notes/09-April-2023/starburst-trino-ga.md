TheÂ Starburst (Trino compatible) connection is now generally available in dbt Cloud. This means you can now use dbt Cloud to connect with Starburst Galaxy, Starburst Enterprise, and self-hosted Trino. This feature is powered by the [`dbt-trino`](https://github.com/starburstdata/dbt-trino) adapter.
