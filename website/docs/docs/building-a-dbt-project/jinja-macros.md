## Overview
In dbt, you can combine SQL with [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/), a templating language.

Using Jinja turns your dbt project into a programming environment for SQL, giving you the ability to do things that aren't normally possible in SQL. For example, with Jinja you can:
* Use control structures (e.g. `if` statements and `for` loops) in SQL
* Use [environment variables](env_var) in your dbt project for production deployments
* Change the way your project builds based on the current target.
* Operate on the results of one query to generate another query, for example:
  * Return a list of payment methods, in order to create a subtotal column per payment method (pivot)
  * Return a list of columns in two relations, and select them in the same order to make it easier to union them together
* Abstract snippets of SQL into reusable [**macros**](#macros) â€” these are analogous to functions in most programming languages.

In fact, if you've used the [`{{ ref() }}` function](ref), you're already using Jinja!

Jinja can be used in any SQL in a dbt project, including [models](building-models), [analyses](analyses), [tests](custom-schema-tests), and even [hooks](hooks-operations).

Check out the [tutorial on using Jinja](using-jinja) for step-by-step example of using Jinja in a model, and turning it into a macro!

## Getting started
### Jinja
Here's an example of a dbt model that leverages Jinja:

<File name='/models/order_payment_method_amounts.sql'>

```sql
{% set payment_methods = ["bank_transfer", "credit_card", "gift_card"] %}

select
    order_id,
    {% for payment_method in payment_methods %}
    sum(case when payment_method = '{{payment_method}}' then amount end) as {{payment_method}}_amount,
    {% endfor %}
    sum(amount) as total_amount
from app_data.payments
group by 1
```

</File>

This query will get compiled to:

<File name='/models/order_payment_method_amounts.sql'>

```sql
select
    order_id,
    sum(case when payment_method = 'bank_transfer' then amount end) as bank_transfer_amount,
    sum(case when payment_method = 'credit_card' then amount end) as credit_card_amount,
    sum(case when payment_method = 'gift_card' then amount end) as gift_card_amount,
    sum(amount) as total_amount
from app_data.payments
group by 1
```

</File>

You can recognize Jinja based on the delimiters the language uses, which we refer to as "curlies":
- **Expressions `{{ ... }}`**: Expressions are used when you want to output a string. You can use expressions to reference [variables](var) and call [macros](jinja-macros#macros).
- **Statements `{% ... %}`**: Statements are used for control flow, for example, to set up `for` loops and `if` statements, or to define macros.
-  **Comments `{# ... #}`**: Jinja comments are used to prevent the text within the comment from compiling.

When used in a dbt model, your Jinja needs to compile to a valid query. To check what SQL your Jinja compiles to:
* **Using dbt Cloud:** Click the compile button to see the compiled SQL in the Compiled SQL pane
* **Using the dbt CLI:** Run `dbt compile` from the command line. Then open the compiled SQL file in the `target/compiled/{project name}/` directory. Use a split screen in your code editor to keep both files open at once.

### Macros
[Macros](jinja-macros#macros) in Jinja are pieces of code that can be reused multiple times â€“ they are analogous to "functions" in other programming languages, and are extremely useful if you find yourself repeating code across multiple models. Macros are defined in `.sql` files, typically in your `macros` directory ([docs](macro-paths)).

Macro files can contain one or more macros â€” here's an example:

<File name='macros/cents_to_dollars.sql'>

```sql

{% macro cents_to_dollars(column_name, precision=2) %}
    ({{ column_name }} / 100)::numeric(16, {{ precision }})
{% endmacro %}

```

</File>

A model which uses this macro might look like:

<File name='models/stg_payments.sql'>

```sql
select
  id as payment_id,
  {{ cents_to_dollars('amount') }} as amount_usd,
  ...
from app_data.payments

```

</File>

This would be _compiled_ to:

<File name='target/compiled/models/stg_payments.sql'>

```sql
select
  id as payment_id,
  (amount / 100)::numeric(16, 2) as amount_usd,
  ...
from app_data.payments
```

</File>


### Using a macro from a package
A number of useful macros have also been grouped together into [packages](package-management) â€” our most popular package is [dbt-utils](https://hub.getdbt.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt_utils/latest/).

After installing a package into your project, you can use any of the macros in your own project â€” make sure you qualify the macro by prefixing it with the [package name](project-configs/name):

```sql

select
  field_1,
  field_2,
  field_3,
  field_4,
  field_5,
  count(*)
from my_table
{{ dbt_utils.group_by(5) }}

```

You can also qualify a macro in your own project by prefixing it with your [package name](project-configs/name) (this is mainly useful for package authors).

Just like well-written python is pythonic, well-written dbt code is dbtonic.

### Favor readability over DRY-ness
Once you learn the power of Jinja, it's common to want to abstract every repeated line into a macro! Remember that using Jinja can make your models harder for other users to interpret â€” we recommend favoring readability when mixing Jinja with SQL, even if it means repeating some lines of SQL in a few places. If all your models are macros, it might be worth re-assessing.

### Leverage package macros
Writing a macro for the first time? Check whether we've open sourced one in [dbt-utils](https://hub.getdbt.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt_utils/latest/) that you can use, and save yourself some time!

### Set variables at the top of a model
`{% set ... %}` can be used to create a new variable, or update an existing one. We recommend setting variables at the top of a model, rather than hardcoding it inline. This is a practice borrowed from many other coding languages, since it helps with readability, and comes in handy if you need to reference the variable in two places:


```sql
-- ðŸ™… This works, but can be hard to maintain as your code grows
{% for payment_methods in ["bank_transfer", "credit_card", "gift_card"] %}
...
{% endfor %}


-- âœ… This is our preferred method of setting variables
{% set payment_methods = ["bank_transfer", "credit_card", "gift_card"] %}

{% for payment_method in payment_methods %}
...
{% endfor %}
```
