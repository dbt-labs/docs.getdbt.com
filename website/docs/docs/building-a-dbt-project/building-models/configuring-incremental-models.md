## About incremental models

Incremental models are built as tables in your <Term id="data-warehouse" />. The first time a model is run, the <Term id="table" /> is built by transforming _all_ rows of source data. On subsequent runs, dbt transforms _only_ the rows in your source data that you tell dbt to filter for, inserting them into the target table which is the table that has already been built.

Often, the rows you filter for on an incremental run will be the rows in your source data that have been created or updated since the last time dbt ran. As such, on each dbt run, your model gets built incrementally.

Using an incremental model limits the amount of data that needs to be transformed, vastly reducing the runtime of your transformations. This improves warehouse performance and reduces compute costs.

## Using incremental materializations

Like the other <Term id="materialization">materializations</Term> built into dbt, incremental models are defined with `select` statements, with the materialization defined in a config block.
```sql
{{
    config(
        materialized='incremental'
    )
}}

select ...

```

To use incremental models, you also need to tell dbt:

* How to filter the rows on an incremental run.
* The uniqueness constraint of the model (if any).

### Filtering rows on an incremental run

To tell dbt which rows it should transform on an incremental run, wrap valid SQL that filters for these rows in the `is_incremental()` macro.

Often, you'll want to filter for "new" rows, as in, rows that have been created since the last time dbt ran this model. The best way to find the timestamp of the most recent run of this model is by checking the most recent timestamp in your target table. dbt makes it easy to query your target table by using the "[{{ this }}](this)" variable.

For example, a model that includes a computationally slow transformation on a column can be built incrementally, as follows:

<File name='models/stg_events.sql'>

```sql
{{
    config(
        materialized='incremental'
    )
}}

select
    *,
    my_slow_function(my_column)

from raw_app_data.events

{% if is_incremental() %}

  -- this filter will only be applied on an incremental run
  where event_time > (select max(event_time) from {{ this }})

{% endif %}
```

</File>



:::tip Optimizing your incremental model

For more complex incremental models that make use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs), you should consider the impact of the position of the `is_incremental()` macro on query performance. In some warehouses, filtering your records early can vastly improve the run time of your query!

:::

### Defining a uniqueness constraint (optional)

A `unique_key` determines whether a record has new values and should be updated. By using `unique_key`, you can ensure that each row from the source table is represented by a single row in your incremental model, without duplicates. Not specifying a `unique_key` will result in append-only behavior, which means dbt inserts all rows returned by the model's SQL into the preexisting target table without regard for whether the rows represent duplicates.

<VersionBlock firstVersion="0.20" lastVersion="1.0">

This optional parameter for incremental models specifies a field that can uniquely identify each row within your model. You can define `unique_key` in a configuration block at the top of your model. If your model doesn't contain a single field that is unique, but rather a combination of columns, we recommend that you create a single column that can serve as unique identifier (by concatenating and hashing those columns), and pass it into your model's configuration.

</VersionBlock>

<VersionBlock firstVersion="1.1">

This optional parameter for incremental models specifies a field (or combination of fields) that can uniquely identify each row within your model. You can define `unique_key` in a configuration block at the top of your model, and it can be a list in addition to a single column name.

The `unique_key` should be supplied in your model definition as a string representing a simple column or a list of single quoted column names that can be used together, for example, `['col1', 'col2', …])`.

:::tip
In cases where you need multiple columns in combination to uniquely identify each row, we recommend you pass these columns as a list (`unique_key = ['user_id', 'session_number']`), rather than a string expression (`unique_key = 'concat(user_id, session_number)'`).

By using the first syntax, which is more universal, dbt can ensure that the columns will be templated into your incremental model materialization in a way that's appropriate to your database.
:::

</VersionBlock>

When you define a `unique_key`, you'll see this behavior for each row of "new" data returned by your dbt model:

* If the same `unique_key` is present in the "new" and "old" model data, dbt will update/replace the old row with the new row of data. The exact mechanics of how that update/replace takes place will vary depending on your database and [incremental strategy](#about-incremental_strategy).
* If the `unique_key` is _not_ present in the "old" data, dbt will insert the entire row into the table.

:::info
While common incremental strategies, such as`delete+insert` + `merge`, might use `unique_key`, others don't. For example, the `insert_overwrite` strategy does not use `unique_key`, because it operates on partitions of data rather than individual rows. For more information, see [About incremental_strategy](#about-incremental_strategy).
:::

#### `unique_key` example

Consider a model that calculates the number of daily active users (DAUs), based on an event stream. As source data arrives, you will want to recalculate the number of DAUs for both the day that dbt last ran, and any days since then. The model would look as follows:

<File name='models/staging/fct_daily_active_users.sql'>

```sql
{{
    config(
        materialized='incremental',
        unique_key='date_day'
    )
}}

select
    date_trunc('day', event_at) as date_day,
    count(distinct user_id) as daily_active_users

from raw_app_data.events


{% if is_incremental() %}

  -- this filter will only be applied on an incremental run
  where date_day >= (select max(date_day) from {{ this }})

{% endif %}

group by 1
```

</File>

Building this model incrementally without the `unique_key` parameter would result in multiple rows in the target table for a single day – one row for each time dbt runs on that day. Instead, the inclusion of the `unique_key` parameter ensures the existing row is updated instead.

## How do I rebuild an incremental model?
If your incremental model logic has changed, the transformations on your new rows of data may diverge from the historical transformations, which are stored in your target table. In this case, you should rebuild your incremental model.

To force dbt to rebuild the entire incremental model from scratch, use the `--full-refresh` flag on the command line. This flag will cause dbt to drop the existing target table in the database before rebuilding it for all-time.

```bash
$ dbt run --full-refresh --select my_incremental_model+
```
It's also advisable to rebuild any downstream models, as indicated by the trailing `+`.

For detailed usage instructions, check out the [dbt run](run) documentation.

# Understanding incremental models
## When should I use an incremental model?
It's often desirable to build models as tables in your data warehouse since downstream queries are more performant. While the `table` materialization also creates your models as tables, it rebuilds the table on each dbt run. These runs can become problematic in that they use a lot of compute when either:
* source data tables have millions, or even billions, of rows.
* the transformations on the source data are computationally expensive (that is, take a long time to execute), for example, complex Regex functions, or UDFs are being used to transform data.

Like many things in programming, incremental models are a trade-off between complexity and performance. While they are not as straightforward as the `view` and `table` materializations, they can lead to significantly better performance of your dbt runs.

## Understanding the is_incremental() macro
The `is_incremental()` macro will return `True` if:
* the destination table already exists in the database
* dbt is _not_ running in full-refresh mode
* the running model is configured with `materialized='incremental'`

Note that the SQL in your model needs to be valid whether `is_incremental()` evaluates to `True` or `False`.

## How do incremental models work behind the scenes?

dbt's incremental materialization works differently on different databases. Where supported, a `merge` statement is used to insert new records and update existing records.

On warehouses that do not support `merge` statements, a merge is implemented by first using a `delete` statement to delete records in the target table that are to be updated, and then an `insert` statement.

Transaction management is used to ensure this is executed as a single unit of work.

## What if the columns of my incremental model change?

:::tip New `on_schema_change` config in dbt version `v0.21.0`

Incremental models can now be configured to include an optional `on_schema_change` parameter to enable additional control when incremental model columns change. These options enable dbt to continue running incremental models in the presence of schema changes, resulting in fewer `--full-refresh` scenarios and saving query costs.  

:::

You can configure the `on_schema_change` setting as follows.

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yaml
models:
  +on_schema_change: "sync_all_columns"
```

</File>

<File name='models/staging/fct_daily_active_users.sql'>

```sql
{{
    config(
        materialized='incremental',
        unique_key='date_day',
        on_schema_change='fail'
    )
}}
```

</File>

The possible values for `on_schema_change` are:  

* `ignore`: Default behavior (see below).
* `fail`: Triggers an error message when the source and target schemas diverge  
* `append_new_columns`: Append new columns to the existing table. Note that this setting does *not* remove columns from the existing table that are not present in the new data.
* `sync_all_columns`: Adds any new columns to the existing table, and removes any columns that are now missing. Note that this is *inclusive* of data type changes. On BigQuery, changing column types requires a full <Term id="table" /> scan; be mindful of the trade-offs when implementing.

**Note**: None of the `on_schema_change` behaviors backfill values in old records for newly added columns. If you need to populate those values, we recommend running manual updates, or triggering a `--full-refresh`.

### Default behavior

This is the behavior if `on_schema_change: ignore`, which is set by default, and on older versions of dbt.

If you add a column to your incremental model, and execute a `dbt run`, this column will _not_ appear in your target table.

Similarly, if you remove a column from your incremental model, and execute a `dbt run`, this column will _not_ be removed from your target table.

Instead, whenever the logic of your incremental changes, execute a full-refresh run of both your incremental model and any downstream models.

## About incremental_strategy

On some adapters, an optional `incremental_strategy` config controls the code that dbt uses
to build incremental models. Different approaches may vary by effectiveness depending on the volume of data,
the reliability of your `unique_key`, or the availability of certain features.

* [Snowflake](snowflake-configs#merge-behavior-incremental-models): `merge` (default), `delete+insert` (optional)
* [BigQuery](bigquery-configs#merge-behavior-incremental-models): `merge` (default), `insert_overwrite` (optional)
* [Spark](spark-configs#incremental-models): `append` (default), `insert_overwrite` (optional), `merge` (optional, Delta-only)

### Configuring incremental strategy

The `incremental_strategy` config can either be specified in specific models, or
for all models in your `dbt_project.yml` file:

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yaml
models:
  +incremental_strategy: "insert_overwrite"
```

</File>

or:

<File name='models/my_model.sql'>

```sql
{{
  config(
    materialized='incremental',
    unique_key='date_day',
    incremental_strategy='delete+insert',
    ...
  )
}}

select ...
```

</File>

### Strategy-specific configs

<Changelog>

  - **v0.20.0:** Introduced `merge_update_columns`
  - **v0.21.0:** Introduced `on_schema_change`

</Changelog>

If you are using the `merge` strategy and have specified a `unique_key`, by default, dbt will entirely overwrite matched rows with new values.

On adapters which support the `merge` strategy (including Snowflake, BigQuery, Apache Spark, and Databricks), you may optionally pass a list of column names to a `merge_update_columns` config. In that case, dbt will update _only_ the columns specified by the config, and keep the previous values of other columns.

<File name='models/my_model.sql'>

```sql
{{
  config(
    materialized = 'incremental',
    unique_key = 'id',
    merge_update_columns = ['email', 'ip_address'],
    ...
  )
}}

select ...
```
