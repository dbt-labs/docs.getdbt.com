dbt Core releases follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). The policies and expectations on this page assume prior familiarity with semantic versions. For more on how we use semantic versions, see "[How dbt Core uses semantic versioning](#how-dbt-core-uses-semantic-versioning)."

### Further reading

- To learn how you can use dbt Core versions in dbt Cloud, see "[Choosing a dbt Core version](cloud-choosing-a-dbt-version)."
- To learn about installing dbt Core, see "[How to install dbt Core](dbt-cli/install/overview)."
- To restrict your project to only work with a range of dbt Core versions, or use the currently running dbt Core version, see [`require-dbt-version`](require-dbt-version) and [`dbt_version`](dbt_version).

## Version support prior to v1.0

- We are no longer releasing new patches for minor versions prior to v1.0.
- As of June 30, 2022, dbt Cloud will remove support for dbt Core versions older than v1.0. At that point, we will also remove v0.20 and v0.21 from the version dropdown on this website.
- You can read the [specific version migration guides](/guides/migration/versions) to understand changes to each version. Each migration guide will link to pages of documentation that were added or updated. Those pages of documentation will also include "Changelog" notes, which you can toggle to see notes on specific changes from each older version.

## Version support starting with v1.0

### Minor version support

Minor versions include new features and capabilities. They will be supported for one year (12 months) from the date of their initial release. _This is a definite commitment._ Our mechanism for continuing to support a minor version is by releasing new patches: small, targeted bug fixes. Whenever we refer to a minor version, such as v1.0, we always mean its latest available patch release (v1.0.x).

While a minor version is officially supported:
- You can use it in dbt Cloud. For more on dbt Cloud versioning, see "[Choosing a dbt version](cloud-choosing-a-dbt-version)."
- You can select it from the version dropdown on this website, to see documentation that is accurate for use with that minor version.

### Ongoing patches

During the 12 months of ongoing support, we will continue to release new patch versions that include fixes.

**Active Support:** In the first few months after a minor version's initial release, we will patch it with "bugfix" releases. These will include fixes for regressions and net-new bugs that were present in the minor version's original release.

**Critical Support:** When a newer minor version is available, we will transition the previous minor version into "Critical Support." Subsequent patches to that older minor version will be "security" releases only, limited to critical fixes related to security and installation.

After a minor version reaches the end of its critical support period, one year after its initial release, no new patches will be released.

### Future versions

We aim to release a new minor "feature" every 3 months. _This is an indicative timeline ONLY._ For the latest information about upcoming releases, including their planned release dates and which features and fixes might be included in each, always consult the [`dbt-core` repository milestones](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/milestones).

:::warning ⚠️ v0.X Non-Supported Period
We are giving accounts until the end of June 2022 to upgrade to dbt 1.0 or later. Pre-dbt 1.0 versions will not receive patch fixes, and our support team will no longer assist with dbt version specific help on non-supported versions of dbt. Additionally, jobs running dbt versions prior to 1.0 will start experiencing service disruptions before the end of the year 2022 and will be removed from the dbt Cloud context by end of the year 2022. You will receive additional email and in app notification before disruption to your production jobs.

## Best practices for upgrading

Because of our new version practice, we've outlined best practices and expectations for dbt users to upgrade as we continue to release new versions of dbt Core.

### Upgrading to new patch versions

We expect users to upgrade to patches as soon as they're available. When we refer to a "minor version" of dbt Core, such as v1.0, we are always referring to the latest available patch release for that minor version. We encourage you to structure your development and production environments so that you can always install the latest patches of `dbt-core` and any adapter plugins. (Note that patch numbers may be different between dbt-core and plugins. [See below](#how-we-version-adapter-plugins) for an explanation.)

### Upgrading to new minor versions

You may continue to use any minor version of dbt while it is officially supported. During that period, it will remain available in dbt Cloud, and in the version dropdown on this website. While we do not expect users to immediately upgrade to newer minor versions as soon as they're available, there will always be some features and fixes that are only available for users of the latest minor version.

### Trying prereleases

All dbt Core versions are available as _prereleases_ before the final release. "Release candidates" are available for testing, in production-like environments, two weeks before the final release. For minor versions, we also aim to release one or more "betas," which include new features and invite community feedback, 4+ weeks before the final release. It is in your interest to help us test prereleases—we need your help!

## How dbt Core uses semantic versioning

Like many software projects, dbt Core releases follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), which defines three types of version releases.

- **Major versions:** To date, dbt Core has had one major version release: v1.0.0. When v2.0.0 is released, it will introduce new features and break backwards compatibility for functionality that has been deprecated.
- **Minor versions**, also called "feature" releases, include a mix of new features, behind-the-scenes improvements, and changes to existing capabilities that are **backwards compatible** with previous minor versions. They will not break code in your project that relies on documented functionality.
- **Patch versions**, also called "bugfix" or "security" releases, include **fixes _only_**. These fixes could be needed to restore previous (documented) behavior, fix obvious shortcomings of new features, or offer critical fixes for security or installation issues. We are judicious about which fixes are included in patch releases, to minimize the surface area of changes.

### How we version adapter plugins

When you use dbt, you're using `dbt-core` together with an adapter plugin specific to your database. You can see the current list in ["Available adapters"](available-adapters). Both `dbt-core` and dbt adapter plugins follow semantic versioning.

`dbt-core` and adapter plugins coordinate new features and behind-the-scenes changes in minor releases. When it comes to fixing bugs, sooner is better—so patch versions are released independently for `dbt-core` and plugins.

What does that mean? Patch version numbers are likely to be different between `dbt-core` and the adapter plugin(s) you have installed. Major and minor version numbers should always match.

As an example, on March 1, you may find you're using `dbt-core==1.0.3` with `dbt-snowflake==1.0.0`. The most important thing is that you're using the latest patch available for each (v1.0.x). If you're running dbt locally, you can use the `dbt --version` command to see which versions you have installed:
```
$ dbt --version
installed version: 1.0.3
   latest version: 1.0.3

Up to date!

Plugins:
  - snowflake: 1.0.0 - Up to date!
```
It's likely that newer patches have become available since then, so it's always important to check and make sure you're up to date!
