## Related documentation
* Coming soon: `groups`
* Coming soon: `access` modifiers

### Groups

Models can be grouped under a common designation with a shared owner.

Why define model `groups`?
- It turns implicit relationships into an explicit grouping
- It enables you to mark specific models as "private" for use _only_ within that group

### Access modifiers

Some models (not all) are designed to be shared across groups.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_modifiers

| Keyword   | Meaning              |
|-----------|----------------------|
| private   | same group           |
| protected | same project/package |
| public    | everybody           |

By default, all models are "protected." This means that other models in the same project can reference them.

:::info Under construction ðŸš§
The following syntax is currently under review and does not work.
:::

<File name="models/marts/customers.yml">

```yaml
groups:
  - name: cx
    owner:
      name: Customer Success Team
      email: cx@jaffle.shop

models:
  - name: dim_customers
    group: cx
    access: public
  # this is an intermediate transformation -- relevant to the CX team only
  - name: int__customer_history_rollup
    group: cx
    access: private
```
