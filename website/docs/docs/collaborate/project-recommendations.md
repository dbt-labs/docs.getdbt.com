dbt Explorer provides recommendations about your project from the `dbt_project_evaluator` [package](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/dbt_project_evaluator/latest/) using metadata from the [Discovery API](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/discovery-api). 

- Explorer also offers a global view, showing all the recommendations across the project for easy sorting and summarizing.
- These recommendations provide insight into how you can create a better-documented, better-tested, and better-built dbt project, creating more trust and less confusion.
- For a seamless and consistent experience, recommendations use `dbt_project_evaluator`'s pre-defined settings and don't import customizations applied to your package or project.

import ExplorerCourse from '/snippets/_explorer-course-link.md';
<ExplorerCourse/>

## Recommendations page
The Recommendations overview page includes two top-level metrics measuring the test and documentation coverage of the models in your project. 

- **Model test coverage** &mdash; The percent of models in your project (models not from a package or imported via dbt Mesh) with at least one dbt test configured on them.
- **Model documentation coverage** &mdash; The percent of models in your project (models not from a package or imported via dbt Mesh) with a description.

## List of rules
The following table lists the rules currently defined in the `dbt_project_evaluator` [package](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/dbt_project_evaluator/latest/). 

| Category | Name | Description | Package Docs Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Modeling | Direct Join to Source | Model that joins both a model and source, indicating a missing staging model | [GitHub](https://dbt-labs.github.io/dbt-project-evaluator/0.8/rules/modeling/#direct-join-to-source) |
| Modeling | Duplicate Sources | More than one source node corresponds to the same data warehouse relation | [GitHub](https://dbt-labs.github.io/dbt-project-evaluator/0.8/rules/modeling/#duplicate-sources) |
| Modeling | Multiple Sources Joined  | Models with more than one source parent, indicating lack of staging models | [GitHub](https://dbt-labs.github.io/dbt-project-evaluator/0.8/rules/modeling/#multiple-sources-joined) |
| Modeling | Root Model | Models with no parents, indicating potential hardcoded references and need for sources  | [GitHub](https://dbt-labs.github.io/dbt-project-evaluator/0.8/rules/modeling/#root-models) |
| Modeling | Source Fanout | Sources with more than one model child, indicating a need for staging models | [GitHub](https://dbt-labs.github.io/dbt-project-evaluator/0.8/rules/modeling/#source-fanout) |
| Modeling | Unused Source | Sources that are not referenced by any resource | [GitHub](https://dbt-labs.github.io/dbt-project-evaluator/0.8/rules/modeling/#unused-sources) |
| Performance | Exposure Dependent on View | Exposures with at least one model parent materialized as a view, indicating potential query performance issues | [GitHub](https://dbt-labs.github.io/dbt-project-evaluator/0.8/rules/performance/#exposure-parents-materializations) |
| Testing | Missing Primary Key Test | Models with insufficient testing on the grain of the model.  | [GitHub](https://dbt-labs.github.io/dbt-project-evaluator/0.8/rules/testing/#missing-primary-key-tests) |
| Documentation | Undocumented Models | Models without a model-level description | [GitHub](https://dbt-labs.github.io/dbt-project-evaluator/0.8/rules/documentation/#undocumented-models) |
| Documentation | Undocumented Source | Sources (collections of source tables) without descriptions | [GitHub](https://dbt-labs.github.io/dbt-project-evaluator/0.8/rules/documentation/#undocumented-sources) |
| Documentation | Undocumented Source Tables | Source tables without descriptions | [GitHub](https://dbt-labs.github.io/dbt-project-evaluator/0.8/rules/documentation/#undocumented-source-tables) |
| Governance | Public Model Missing Contract | Models with public access that do not have a model contract to ensure the data types | [GitHub](https://dbt-labs.github.io/dbt-project-evaluator/0.8/rules/governance/#public-models-without-contracts) |


## The Recommendations tab

Models, sources, and exposures each also have a **Recommendations** tab on their resource details page, with the specific recommendations that correspond to that resource:
