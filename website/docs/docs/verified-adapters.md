The dbt Labs has a rigorous verified adapter program that provides reassurance to users about which adapters can be trusted to use in production, has been tested, and is actively maintained and updated. The process covers development, documentation, user experience, and maintenance aspects.

These adapters then earn a "Verified" status so that users can have a certain level of trust and expectation when they use them. The adapters also have maintainers and we recommend using the adapter's verification status to determine its quality and health.

The verification process serves as the on-ramp to integration with dbt Cloud. As such, we restrict applicants to data platform vendors with whom we are already engaged.

To learn more, refer to the [Build, test, document, and promote adapters](/guides/adapter-creation) guide.
