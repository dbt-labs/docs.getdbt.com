Begin your dbt journey by trying one of our quickstarts, which provides a step-by-step guide to help you set up dbt Cloud or dbt Core with a [variety of data platforms](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/about-connections).

## dbt Cloud

dbt Cloud is a scalable solution that enables you to develop, test, deploy, and explore data products using a single, fully managed software service. It enables teams with diverse skills to build reliable data products at any scale, with capabilities including:

- Development experiences tailored to multiple personas (in-browser [dbt Cloud IDE](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud) or locally with the [dbt Cloud CLI](/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation))
- Out-of-the-box [CI/CD workflows](/docs/deploy/ci-jobs)
- The [dbt Semantic Layer](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/dbt-sl) for consistent metrics that can be delivered to any endpoint
- Domain ownership of data with multi-project [dbt Mesh](/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-1-intro) setups
- [dbt Explorer](/docs/collaborate/explore-projects) for collaborative data discovery and understanding

## dbt Core

[dbt Core](/docs/core/about-core-setup) is a command-line [open-source tool](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core) that enables data practitioners to transform data using analytics engineering best practices. It suits individuals and small technical teams who prefer manual setup and customization, supports community adapters, and open-source standards.

Refer to the following quickstarts to get started with dbt Core:

- [dbt Core from a manual install](/guides/manual-install) to learn how to install dbt Core and set up a project.
- [dbt Core using GitHub Codespace](/guides/codespace?step=1) to learn how to create a codespace and execute the `dbt build` command.
