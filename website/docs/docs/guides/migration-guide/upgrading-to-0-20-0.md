### Resources

- [Discourse](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/2621)
- [Release notes](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/releases/tag/v0.20.0)
- [Full changelog](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/blob/0.20.latest/CHANGELOG.md)

## Breaking changes

- Schema test macros are now `test` blocks, which we're going to start calling "generic tests." There is backwards compatibility for schema test macros prefixed `test_`, and you can still use them without switching to test blocks (though we hope you will soon!). The biggest breaking change is that _all_ tests now return a set of failing rows, rather than a single numeric value. This resolved a longstanding inconsistency between schema tests and data tests.
- **For package maintainers (and some users):** The syntax for `adapter.dispatch()` has changed; see linked documentation below.
- **For adapter plugin maintainers:** Macro dispatch now includes "parent" adapter implementations before using the default implementation. If you maintain an adapter plugin that inherits from another adapter (e.g. `dbt-redshift` inherits from `dbt-postgres`), `adapter.dispatch()` will now look for prefixed macros in the following order: `redshift__`, `postgres__`, `default__`.
- **For artifact users:** The [manifest](manifest-json) and [run_results](run-results-json) now use a v2 schema. What changed: there are a handful of new properties in the manifest; the number of failures for a test has been moved to a new property `failures`, so that `message` can be the human-readable failure message.

## New and changed documentation

### Tests
- [Building a dbt Project: tests](building-a-dbt-project/tests)
- [Test Configs](test-configs)
- [Test properties](resource-properties/tests)
- [Node Selection](node-selection/syntax) (with updated [test selection examples](test-selection-examples))
- [Writing custom generic tests](custom-generic-tests)

### Elsewhere in Core
- [Parsing](parsing): rework of partial parsing, introduction of experimental parser
- The [graph](graph) Jinja context variable includes `exposures`
- [Packages](package-management) can now be installed from git with a specific commit hash as the revision, or via sparse checkout if the dbt project is located in a `subdirectory`.
- [adapter.dispatch](dispatch) supports new arguments, a new [project-level config](project-configs/dispatch-config), and includes parent adapters when searching for macro implementations.
- [Exposures](exposure-properties) support `tags` and `meta` properties

### Plugins
- New partition-related [BigQuery configs](bigquery-configs#additional-partition-configs): `require_partition_filter` and `partition_expiration_days`
- On BigQuery, dbt can now add [query comment](query-comment) items as job labels
- Snowflake and BigQuery [incremental models](configuring-incremental-models#strategy-specific-configs) using the `merge` strategy accept a new optional config, `merge_update_columns`.
- [Postgres configs](postgres-configs) now include first-class support for `indexes`
