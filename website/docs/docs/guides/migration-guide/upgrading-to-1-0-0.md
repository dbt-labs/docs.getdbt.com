### Resources

- [Changelog](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md)

## Breaking changes

- The two type of test definitions are now "singular" and "generic" (instead of "data" and "schema", respectively). The `test_type:` selection method accepts `test_type:singular` and `test_type:generic`. (It will also accept test_type:schema and test_type:data for backwards compatibility.) **Not backwards compatible:** The `--data` and `--schema` flags to dbt test are no longer supported, and tests no longer have the tags `'data'` and `'schema'` automatically applied.

## New and changed documentation

- [Tests](building-a-dbt-project/tests), [test selection](test-selection-examples), [selection methods](node-selection/methods): Update `test_type:` selection method. Remove references to `--schema` and `--data` flags.
- [Parsing](parsing): partial parsing and static parsing have been turned on by default
- [Global configs](global-configs) have been standardized. Related updates to [global CLI flags](global-cli-flags) [`profiles.yml`](profiles.yml).
