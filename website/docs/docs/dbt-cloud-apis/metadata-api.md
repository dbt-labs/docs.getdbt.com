## About the metadata API

Every time that dbt Cloud runs a dbt project, it generates metadata which pertains to the accuracy, recency, configuration, and structure of the <Term id="view">views</Term> and tables in the warehouse. dbt Cloud serves a GraphQL API which supports arbitrary queries over this metadata; the endpoint for this API is `https://metadata.cloud.getdbt.com/graphql`. This API is an incredibly rich resource for evaluating data health longitudinally or at a point in time.

## Prerequisites

The metadata API is available to accounts on the _Team_ and _Enterprise_ plans, for any version >= dbt v0.19.0. Please note that artifacts generated with a version of dbt _less than_ v0.19.0 will not be accessible via the dbt Cloud metadata API. For information on upgrading, see "[Version migration guides](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/migration/versions)."

## How to browse the API

We also provide a [graphical explorer](https://metadata.cloud.getdbt.com/graphiql) for this API where you can run ad-hoc queries or browse the schema. As GraphQL provides a self-describing API, the schema shown in the GraphiQL interface is an accurate representation of the graph and fields available to query on at any point in time.

## Retention limits for data

You can use the metadata API to query data from the previous 3 months. For example, if today was March 1, you could query data back to January 1st.

*We are continuously expanding the capabilities of the metadata API and we welcome your feedback and suggestions at metadata@dbtlabs.com.*
