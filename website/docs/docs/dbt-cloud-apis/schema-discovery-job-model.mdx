import { NodeArgsTable, SchemaTable } from "./schema";

The model object allows you to query information about a particular model in a given job.

### Arguments

When querying for a `model`, the following arguments are available.

<NodeArgsTable parent="JobNode" name="model" />

Below we show some illustrative example queries and outline the schema (all possible fields you can query) of this model object.

### Example Queries
#### Finding parent models and sources

The example query below uses the `parentsModels` and `parentsSources` fields to fetch information about a model’s parent models and parent sources. Note that we put a placeholder jobID and uniqueID, which you will have to replace.

```graphql
{
  job(id: 123) {
    model(uniqueId: "model.jaffle_shop.dim_user") {
      parentsModels {
        runId
        uniqueId
        executionTime
      }
      parentsSources {
        runId
        uniqueId
        state
      }
    }
  }
}

```

#### Model Timing

The example query below could be useful if we wanted to understand information around execution timing on a given model (start, end, completion).

```graphql
{
  job(id: 123) {
    model(uniqueId: "model.jaffle_shop.dim_user") {
      runId
      projectId
      name
      uniqueId
      resourceType
      executeStartedAt
      executeCompletedAt
      executionTime
    }
  }
}
```

#### Column-level information

You can use the following example query to understand more about the columns of a given model.  Note that this will only work if the job has generated documentation. For example it will work with the command `dbt docs generate`.

```graphql
{
  job(id: 123) {
    model(uniqueId: "model.jaffle_shop.dim_user") {
      columns {
        name
        index
        type
        comment
        description
        tags
        meta
      }
    }
  }
}
```


### Fields

When querying for a `model`, the following fields are available:

<SchemaTable nodeName="ModelNode" />
