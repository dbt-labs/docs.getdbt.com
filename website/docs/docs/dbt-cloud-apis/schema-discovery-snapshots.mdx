import { ArgsTable, SchemaTable } from "./schema";

The snapshots object allows you to query information about all snapshots in a given job.

import DiscoveryApiJobDeprecationNotice from '/snippets/_discovery_api_job_deprecation_notice.md';

<DiscoveryApiJobDeprecationNotice />

### Arguments

When querying for `snapshots`, the following arguments are available. Note that if you do not include a runId, it will default to the most recent run of the specified job:

<ArgsTable queryName="snapshots" />

Below we show some illustrative example queries and outline the schema of this snapshots object.

### Example Query
As we noted above, database, schema, and identifier are all optional arguments.  This means that with this endpoint, you can:
- Find a specific snapshot by providing `<database>.<schema>.<identifier>`
- Find all of the snapshots in a database and/or schema by providing `<database>` and/or `<schema>`

#### Finding snapshots information for a job
The example query returns information about all snapshots in this job.

```graphql
{
  snapshots(jobId: 123) {
    uniqueId
    name
    executionTime
    environmentId
    executeStartedAt
    executeCompletedAt
  }
}

```

### Fields
Snapshots has access to the *same fields* as the [Snapshot node](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/discovery-schema-snapshots).  The difference is that Snapshots can output a list, so instead of querying for fields for one specific snapshot, you can query for those parameters for all snapshots within a jobID, database, etc.

When querying for `snapshots`, the following fields are available:

<SchemaTable nodeName="SnapshotNode" />
