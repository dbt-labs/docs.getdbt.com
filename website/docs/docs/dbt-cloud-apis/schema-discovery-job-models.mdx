The models object allows you to query information about all models in a given job.

### Arguments

When querying for `models`, the following arguments are available.

<NodeArgsTable parent="JobNode" name="models" />

Below we show some illustrative example queries and outline the schema of the models object.

### Example queries
The database, schema, and identifier arguments are all optional. This means that with this endpoint you can:

- Find a specific model by providing `<database>.<schema>.<identifier>`
- Find all of the models in a database and/or schema by providing `<database>` and/or `<schema>`

#### Find models by their database, schema, and identifier
The example query below finds a model by its unique database, schema, and identifier.

```graphql
{
  job(id: 123) {
    models(database:"analytics", schema: "analytics", identifier:"dim_customers") {
      uniqueId
    }
  }
}
```

#### Find models by their schema
The example query below finds all models in this schema and their respective execution times.

```graphql
{
  job(id: 123) {
    models(schema: "analytics") {
      uniqueId
      executionTime
    }
  }
}
```


### Fields
The models object can access the _same fields_ as the [Model node](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/discovery-schema-job-model). The difference is that the models object can output a list so instead of querying for fields for one specific model, you can query for those parameters for all models within a jobID, database, and so on.

When querying for `models`, the following fields are available:

<SchemaTable nodeName="ModelNode" />
