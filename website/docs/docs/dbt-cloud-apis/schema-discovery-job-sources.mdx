import { NodeArgsTable, SchemaTable } from "./schema";

The sources object allows you to query information about all sources in a given job.

### Arguments

When querying for `sources`, the following arguments are available.

<NodeArgsTable parent="JobNode" name="sources" />

Below we show some illustrative example queries and outline the schema of the sources object.

### Example queries

The database, schema, and identifier arguments are optional. This means that with this endpoint you can:

- Find a specific source by providing `<database>.<schema>.<identifier>`
- Find all of the sources in a database and/or schema by providing `<database>` and/or `<schema>`

#### Finding sources by their database, schema, and identifier

The example query below finds a source by its unique database, schema, and identifier.

```graphql
{
  job(id: 123) {
    sources(
      database: "analytics"
      schema: "analytics"
      identifier: "dim_customers"
    ) {
      uniqueId
    }
  }
}
```

#### Finding sources by their schema

The example query below finds all sources in this schema and their respective states (pass, error, fail).

```graphql
{
  job(id: 123) {
    sources(schema: "analytics") {
      uniqueId
      state
    }
  }
}
```

### Fields

The sources object can access the _same fields_ as the [source node](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/discovery-schema-job-source). The difference is that the sources object can output a list so instead of querying for fields for one specific source, you can query for those parameters for all sources within a jobID, database, and so on.

When querying for `sources`, the following fields are available:

<SchemaTable nodeName="SourceNode" />
