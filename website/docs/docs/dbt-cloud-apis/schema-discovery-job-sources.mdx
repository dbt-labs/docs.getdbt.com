import { NodeArgsTable, SchemaTable } from "./schema";

The sources object allows you to query information about all sources in a given job.

### Arguments

When querying for `sources`, the following arguments are available.

<NodeArgsTable parent="JobNode" name="sources" />

Below we show some illustrative example queries and outline the schema of this sources object.

### Example Queries

As we noted above, database, schema, and identifier are all optional arguments. This means that with this endpoint, you can:

- Find a specific source by providing `<database>.<schema>.<identifier>`
- Find all of the sources in a database and/or schema by providing `<database>` and/or `<schema>`

#### Finding sources by their database, schema, and identifier

The example query below finds a source by its unique database, schema, and identifier.

```graphql
{
  job(id: 123) {
    sources(
      database: "analytics"
      schema: "analytics"
      identifier: "dim_customers"
    ) {
      uniqueId
    }
  }
}
```

#### Finding sources by their schema

The example query below finds all sources in this schema, and their respective states (pass, error, fail).

```graphql
{
  job(id: 123) {
    sources(schema: "analytics") {
      uniqueId
      state
    }
  }
}
```

### Fields

Sources has access to the _same fields_ as the [Source node](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/discovery-schema-job-source). The difference is that Sources can output a list, so instead of querying for fields for one specific source, you can query for those parameters for all sources within a jobID, database, etc.

When querying for `sources`, the following fields are available:

<SchemaTable nodeName="SourceNode" />
