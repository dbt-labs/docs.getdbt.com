[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) (GQL) is an open-source query language for APIs. It offers a more efficient and flexible approach compared to traditional RESTful APIs. 

With GraphQL, users can request specific data using a single query, reducing the need for many server round trips. This improves performance and minimizes network overhead.

GraphQL has several advantages, such as self-documenting, having a strong typing system, supporting versioning and evolution, enabling rapid development, and having a robust ecosystem. These features make GraphQL a powerful choice for APIs that prioritize flexibility, performance, and developer productivity.

## dbt Semantic Layer GraphQL API

The dbt Semantic Layer GraphQL API allows you to explore and query metrics and dimensions. Due to it's self-documenting nature, you can explore the calls conveniently through the [schema explorer](https://cloud.getdbt.com/semantic-layer/api/graphql). 

dbt Partners can use the Semantic Layer GraphQL API to build and integration with the dbt Semantic Layer.

## Using the GraphQL API

If you're a dbt user or partner with access to dbt Cloud and the [dbt Semantic Layer](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/dbt-sl), you can [setup](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/setup-sl) and test this API with data from your own instance by configuring the Semantic Layer and obtaining the right GQL connection parameters described in this document. 

Refer to [Get started with the dbt Semantic Layer](docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/quickstart-sl) for more info.

### Authentication 

Authentication uses a dbt Cloud [service account tokens](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/service-tokens) passed through a header as follows. To explore the schema, you can enter this information in the "header" section.

```
{"Authorization": "Bearer <SERVICE TOKEN>"}
```

Each GQL request also comes with a dbt Cloud environmentId. The API uses both the service token in the header and environmentId for authentication.

### Metric metadata calls

Use the following example calls to provide you with an idea of the types of commands you can use:

**Fetch available metrics**

```graphql
metrics(environmentId: Int!): [Metric!]!
```

**Fetch available dimensions for metrics**

```graphql
dimensions(
environmentId: Int!
metrics: [String!]!
): [Dimension!]!
```

**Fetch available time granularities given metrics**

```graphql
queryableGranularities(
environmentId: Int!
metrics: [String!]!
): [TimeGranularity!]!
```

**Fetch available metrics given a set of a dimensions**

```graphql
metricsForDimensions(
environmentId: Int!
dimensions: [String!]!
): [Metric!]!
```

**Fetch dimension values for metrics and a given dimension**

```graphql
dimensionValues(
environmentId: Int!
metrics: [String!]!
dimension: String!
```

### Metric value query parameters

The mutation is `createQuery`. The parameters are as follows:

```graphql
createQuery(
environmentId: Int!
metrics: [String!]!
dimensions: [String!] = null
limit: Int = null
startTime: String = null
endTime: String = null
where: String = null
order: [String!] = null
): String
```
