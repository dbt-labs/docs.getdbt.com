# Service account tokens <Lifecycle status="team,enterprise"/>

:::info Important service account token update

If you have service tokens created on or before July 18, 2023, please read [this important update](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/service-tokens#service-token-update).

:::

Service account tokens enable you to securely authenticate with the dbt Cloud API by assigning each token a narrow set of permissions that more precisely manages access to the API. While similar to [User API tokens](user-tokens), service account tokens belong to an account rather than a user.

You can use service account tokens for system-level integrations that do not run on behalf of any one user. Assign any permission sets available in dbt Cloud to your service account token, which can vary slightly depending on your plan:

* Enterprise plans can apply any permission sets available to service tokens.
* Team plans can apply Account Admin, Member, Job Admin, Read-Only, Metadata, and Semantic Layer permissions set to service tokens.

You can assign as many permission sets as needed to one token. For more on permissions sets, see "[Enterprise Permissions](/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions)."

## Generate service account tokens

You can generate service tokens if you have a Developer [license](/docs/cloud/manage-access/seats-and-users) and account admin [permissions](/docs/cloud/manage-access/about-user-access#permission-sets). To create a service token in dbt Cloud, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Account Settings** page by clicking the gear icon on the right-hand side.
2. On the left sidebar, click on **Service Tokens**.
3. Click the **+ New Token** button to generate a new token.
4. Once the token is generated, you won't be able to view this token again so make sure to save it somewhere safe.

## Permissions for service account tokens

You can assign service account tokens to any permission set available in dbt Cloud. When you assign a permission set to a token, you will also be able to choose whether to grant those permissions to all projects in the account or to specific projects.

### Team plans using service account tokens

The following permissions can be assigned to a service account token on a Team plan.

**Account Admin**<br/>
Account Admin service tokens have full `read + write` access to an account, so please use them with caution.  A Team plan refers to this permission set as an "Owner role." For more on these permissions, see [Account Admin](/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions#account-admin).

**Metadata Only**<br/>
Metadata-only service tokens authorize requests to the Discovery API.

**Semantic Layer Only**<br/>
Semantic Layer-only service tokens authorize requests to the Semantic Layer APIs.

**Job Admin**<br/>
Job admin service tokens can authorize requests for viewing, editing, and creating environments, triggering runs, and viewing historical runs. 

**Job Runner**<br/>
Job runner service tokens can authorize requests for triggering runs and viewing historical runs.

**Member** <br/>
Member service tokens can authorize requests for viewing and editing resources, triggering runs, and inviting members to the account. Tokens assigned the Member permission set will have the same permissions as a Member user. For more information about Member users, see "[Self-service Team plan permissions](/docs/cloud/manage-access/self-service-permissions)".

**Read-only**<br/>
Read-only service tokens can authorize requests for viewing a read-only dashboard, viewing generated documentation, and viewing source freshness reports. This token can access and retrieve account-level information endpoints on the [Admin API](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/admin-cloud-api) and authorize requests to the [Discovery API](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/discovery-api). 

### Enterprise plans using service account tokens

The following permissions can be assigned to a service account token on an Enterprise plan. For more details about these permissions, see "[Enterprise permissions](/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions)."

**Account Admin** <br/>

Security Admin service tokens have certain account-level permissions.  For more on these permissions, see [Security Admin](/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions#security-admin).

**Billing Admin** <br/>
Billing Admin service tokens have certain account-level permissions.  For more on these permissions, see [Billing Admin](/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions#billing-admin).

**Manage marketplace apps** <br/>
Used only for service tokens assigned to marketplace apps (for example, the [Snowflake Native app](/docs/cloud-integrations/snowflake-native-app)). 

**Metadata Only**<br/>
Metadata-only service tokens authorize requests to the Discovery API.

**Semantic Layer Only**<br/>

**Admin** <br/>
Admin service tokens have unrestricted access to projects in dbt Cloud accounts. You have the option to grant that permission all projects in the account or grant the permission only on specific projects. For more on these permissions, see [Admin Service](/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions#admin-service) on the Enterprise Permissions page.

## Service token update

On July 18, 2023, dbt Labs made critical infrastructure changes to service account tokens. These enhancements improve the security and performance of all tokens created after July 18, 2023. To ensure security best practices are in place, we recommend you rotate your service tokens created before this date.

To rotate your token:
1. Navigate to **Account settings** and click **Service tokens** on the left side pane.
2. Verify the **Created** date for the token is _on or before_ July 18, 2023. 
    <Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/service-token-date.png" title="Service token created date"/>
3. Click **+ New Token** on the top right side of the screen. Ensure the new token has the same permissions as the old one. 
4. Copy the new token and replace the old one in your systems. Store it in a safe place, as it will not be available again once the creation screen is closed.
5. Delete the old token in dbt Cloud by clicking the **trash can icon**. _Only take this action after the new token is in place to avoid service disruptions_.
