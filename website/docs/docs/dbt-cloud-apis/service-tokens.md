## About service tokens

Service account tokens enable you to securely authenticate with the dbt Cloud API by assigning each token a narrow set of permissions that more precisely manages access to the API. While similar to [User API tokens](user-tokens), service account tokens belong to an account rather than a user.

You can use service account tokens for system-level integrations that do not run on behalf of any one user. Assign any permission sets available in dbt Cloud to your service account token, which can vary slightly depending on your plan:

* Enterprise plans can apply any permission sets available to service tokens.
* Team plans can apply Account Admin, Member, Job Admin, Read-Only, and Metadata permissions sets to service tokens.

You can assign as many permission sets as needed to one token. For more on permissions sets, see "[Enterprise Permissions](/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions)."

## Generating service account tokens

In the Account Settings view of dbt Cloud, you can click on the Service Account tokens page and generate a new token. Create and save your token somewhere safe.

:::caution Note

You will not be able to view this token again after generating it, so store the token somewhere safe for later use.

## Permissions for service account tokens

You can assign service account tokens any permission set available in dbt Cloud. When you assign a permission set to a token, you will also be able to choose whether to grant that permissions to all projects in the account or to specific projects.

### Team plans using service account tokens

The following permissions can be assigned to a service account token on a Team plan.

**Account Admin**<br/>
