The sources object allows you to query information about all sources in a given job.

import DiscoveryApiJobDeprecationNotice from '/snippets/_discovery_api_job_deprecation_notice.md';

<DiscoveryApiJobDeprecationNotice />

### Arguments

When querying for `sources`, the following arguments are available. Note that if you do not include a runId, it will default to the most recent run of the specified job:

<ArgsTable queryName="sources" />

Below we show some illustrative example queries and outline the schema of this sources object.

### Example Queries
As we noted above, database, schema, and identifier are all optional arguments.  This means that with this endpoint, you can:
- Find a specific source by providing `<database>.<schema>.<identifier>`
- Find all of the sources in a database and/or schema by providing `<database>` and/or `<schema>`

#### Finding sources by their database, schema, and identifier
The example query below finds a source by its unique database, schema, and identifier.

```graphql
{
  sources(jobId: 123, database:"analytics", schema: "analytics", identifier:"dim_customers") {
    uniqueId
  }
}
```

#### Finding sources by their schema
The example query below finds all sources in this schema, and their respective states (pass, error, fail).

```graphql
{
  sources(jobId: 123, schema: "analytics") {
    uniqueId
    state
  }
}
```

### Fields
Sources has access to the *same fields* as the [Source node](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/discovery-schema-source).  The difference is that Sources can output a list, so instead of querying for fields for one specific source, you can query for those parameters for all sources within a jobID, database, etc.

When querying for `sources`, the following fields are available:

<SchemaTable nodeName="SourceNode" />
