The dbt Cloud Administrative API is enabled by default for _Team_ and _Enterprise_ plans. It can be used to:

- Download artifacts after a job has completed
- Kick off a job run from an orchestration tool
- Manage your dbt Cloud account
- and more

You can use [dbt Cloud Administrative API v2 reference documentation](/dbt-cloud/api-v2) to help you access the API.
