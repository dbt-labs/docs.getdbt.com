The dbt Cloud Administrative API is enabled by default for _Team_ and _Enterprise_ plans. It can be used to:

- Download artifacts after a job has completed
- Kick off a job run from an orchestration tool
- Manage your dbt Cloud account
- and more

You can use [dbt Cloud Administrative API v2 reference documentation](/dbt-cloud/api-v2) to help you access the API. For information about migrating from API v4 to API v2, refer to [Migrating to dbt Cloud Administrative API v2](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/migrating-to-v2).
