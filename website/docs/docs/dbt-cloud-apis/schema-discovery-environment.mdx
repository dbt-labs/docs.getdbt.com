This environment object allows you to query information about a particular model based on `environmentId`.

The [example query](#example-query) illustrates a few fields you can query in this `environment` object. Refer to [Fields](#fields) to see the entire schema, which provides all possible fields you can query.

### Arguments

When querying for `environment`, you can use the following arguments.

<ArgsTable queryName="environment" useBetaAPI />


### Example Query

You can use your production environment's `id`: 

```graphql
query Example {
	environment(id: 834){ # Get the latest state of the production environment 
		applied { # The state of an executed node as it exists as an object in the database
			models(first: 100){ # Pagination to ensure manageable response for large projects
				edges { node {
					uniqueId, name, description, rawCode, compiledCode, # Basic properties
					database, schema, alias, # Table/view identifier (can also filter by)
					executionInfo {executeCompletedAt, executionTime}, # Metadata from when the model was built
					tests {name, executionInfo{lastRunStatus, lastRunError}}, # Latest test results
					catalog {columns {name, description, type}, stats {label, value}}, # Catalog info
					ancestors(types:[Source]) {name, ...on SourceAppliedStateNode {freshness{maxLoadedAt, freshnessStatus}}}, # Source freshness } 
					children {name, resourceType}}} # Immediate dependencies in lineage	
				totalCount } # Number of models in the project
		}
		definition { # The logical state of a given project node given its most recent manifest generated
			models(first: 100, filter:{access:public}){ # Filter on model access (or other properties)
				edges { node {
					rawCode, # Compare to see if/how the model has changed since the last build
					jobDefinitionId, runGeneratedAt,	# When the code was last compiled or run
					contractEnforced, group, version}}} # Model governance
		}
	}
```
