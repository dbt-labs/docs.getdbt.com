The dbt Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a single interface for building, testing, running, and version controlling dbt projects.

### Requirements

- The dbt IDE is powered by [dbt-rpc](rpc) which has been overhauled in dbt v0.15.0. In order to use the IDE, your dbt project must be compatible with dbt v0.15.0.
- To use the IDE, you must have a [Developer License](cloud-seats-and-users). 
- Write access must be enabled for your dbt repository in dbt Cloud. See [Connecting your GitHub Account](cloud-installing-the-github-application) and [Importing a project by git URL](cloud-import-a-project-by-git-url) for detailed setup instructions.

### Creating a development environment
New dbt Cloud accounts will automatically be created with a Development Environment for the project created during setup. If you have an existing dbt Cloud account, you may need to create a Development Environment manually to use the dbt IDE.

To create a development environment, choose **Deploy** > **Environments** from the top left. Then, click **Create Environment**.

Enter an environment **Name** that would help you identify it among your other environments (for example, `Nate's Development Environment`). Choose **Development** as the **Environment Type**. You can also select which **dbt Version** to use at this time. For compatibility reasons, we recommend that you select the same dbt version that you plan to use in your deployment environment. Finally, click **Save** to finish creating your development environment.

### Setting up developer credentials

The IDE uses *developer credentials* to connect to your database. These developer credentials should be specific to your user. They should *not* be super user credentials, or the same credentials that you use for your production deployment of dbt.

New dbt Cloud accounts should have developer credentials created automatically as a part of Project creation in the initial application setup.

New users on existing accounts *might not* have their development credentials already configured. To manage your development credentials, go to the [Credentials](https://cloud.getdbt.com/next/settings/profile#credentials) section. Select the relevant project in the list. After entering your developer credentials, you'll be able to access the dbt IDE.
