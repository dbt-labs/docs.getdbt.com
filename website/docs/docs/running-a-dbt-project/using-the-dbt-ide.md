The dbt Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a single interface for building, testing, running, and version controlling dbt projects. We encourage you to use the IDE and share your feedback with the dbt Cloud team.

### Requirements

- The dbt IDE is powered by the [dbt Server](rpc) which has been overhauled in dbt v0.15.0. In order to use the IDE, your dbt project must be compatible with dbt v0.15.0.
- To use the IDE, you must have a [Developer License](cloud-seats-and-users). 
- Write access must be enabled for your dbt repository in dbt Cloud. See [Connecting your GitHub Account](cloud-installing-the-github-application) and [Importing a project by git URL](cloud-import-a-project-by-git-url) for detailed setup instructions.

### Creating a development environment
New dbt Cloud accounts will automatically be created with a Development Environment for the project created during setup. If you have an existing dbt Cloud account, you may need to create a Development Environment manually to use the dbt IDE.

To create a Development Environment, navigate to the Environments page for your Project and click the "New Environment" button.

To create a Development Environment, change the environment "type" to "development". Enter a name like "Dev" for the environment to help identify it amongst your other environments. Finally, click "Save" to finish creating your Development Environment.

### Setting up developer credentials

The IDE uses *developer credentials* to connect to your database. These developer credentials should be specific to your user. They should *not* be super user credentials, or the same credentials that you use for your production deployment of dbt.

New dbt Cloud accounts should have developer credentials created automatically as a part of Project creation in the initial application setup.

Existing accounts *may not* have development credentials configured already. To manage your development credentials, navigate to your [Profile](https://cloud.getdbt.com/#/profile/) in dbt Cloud and find the relevant Project under the **Credentials** header. After entering your developer credentials, you'll be able to access the dbt IDE.
