dbt connects to and runs SQL against your database, warehouse, platform, or query engine. It works by using a dedicated **adapter** for each technology. All the adapters listed below are open source and free to use, just like dbt.

### Installation

Most adapters can be installed from PyPi using `pip`. The installation will include `dbt-core` and any other required dependencies, which may include other adapter plugins. Read more about [installing dbt](dbt-cli/install/overview).

Some vendor or community adapters may not exist in PyPi. However, you can still install an adapter hosted on GitHub with `pip install`, by replacing MAINTAINER_NAME with the person or company maintaining the adapter on GitHub and ADAPTER_NAME with the git repository's name (these can be taken directly from the adapter's url):

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/MAINTAINER_NAME/ADAPTER_NAME.git
```

### dbt Labs Supported

In addition to maintaining `dbt-core`, [dbt Labs](https://github.com/dbt-labs) maintains a set of adapters for some of the most common databases, warehouses, and platforms. (âœ… indicates "full support.")

Community-supported plugins are works in progress, and anyone is welcome to contribute by testing and writing code. If you're interested in contributing:
- Join both the dedicated #adapter-ecosystem channel in [dbt Slack](https://community.getdbt.com/) and the channel for your adapter's data store (e.g. #db-sqlserver, #db-athena) 
- Check out the open issues in the plugin's source repository

Note that, while no community plugins are currently supported in dbt Cloud, we expect this to change in the near future.

## Creating a new adapter

dbt can be extended to any SQL-speaking database, warehouse, data lake, query engine, or analytical platform by means of an _adapter plugin_. These plugins can be built as separate Python modules, and dbt will discover them if they are installed on your system. If you see something missing from the lists above, and you're interested in developing an integration, read more about [building a new adapter](building-a-new-adapter).
