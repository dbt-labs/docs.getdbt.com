:::info Coming soon
The dbt Semantic Layer is undergoing a [significant revamp](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-semantic-layer-whats-next/), making it more efficient to define and query metrics.

**Whatâ€™s changing?** The dbt_metrics package will be [deprecated](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/deprecating-dbt-metrics) and replaced with [MetricFlow](/docs/build/about-metricflow?version=1.6), a new way framework for defining metrics in dbt.

**What's new?**  Learn how to [Build your metrics](/docs/build/build-metrics-intro?version=1.6) using MetricFlow, one of the key components that makes up the revamped dbt Semantic Layer. It handles SQL query construction and defines the specification for dbt semantic models and metrics. 
:::

With the dbt Semantic Layer, you'll be able to centrally define business metrics, reduce code duplication and inconsistency, create self-service in downstream tools, and more. Configure the dbt Semantic Layer in dbt Cloud to connect with your integrated partner tool.
