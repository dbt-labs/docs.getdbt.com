:::info Coming soon
The dbt Semantic Layer is undergoing some [sophisticated changes](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-semantic-layer-whats-next/), enabling you to define more complex metrics and query them efficiently.

**What’s changing?** The dbt_metrics package will be [deprecated](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/deprecating-dbt-metrics) and replaced with [MetricFlow](/docs/build/about-metricflow?version=1.6), a new way to define metrics in dbt.

**What's new?**  Learn how to [Build your metrics](/docs/build/build-metrics-intro?version=1.6) using MetricFlow, one of the key components that makes up the revamped dbt Semantic Layer. It handles SQL query construction and defines the specification for dbt semantic models and metrics. 
:::

A wide variety of data applications across the modern data stack natively integrate with the dbt Semantic Layer and dbt metrics &mdash; from Business Intelligence tools to notebooks, data catalogs, and more.

The dbt Semantic Layer integrations are capable of querying dbt metrics, importing definitions, surfacing the underlying data in partner tools, and leveraging the dbt Server. 

For information on the partner integrations, their documentation, and more &mdash; refer to the [dbt Semantic Layer integrations](https://www.getdbt.com/product/semantic-layer-integrations) page.
