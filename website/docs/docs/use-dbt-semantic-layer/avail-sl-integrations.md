# Available integrations

A wide variety of data applications across the modern data stack natively integrate with the dbt Semantic Layer and dbt metrics &mdash; from Business Intelligence tools to notebooks, data catalogs, and more.

The dbt Semantic Layer integrations are capable of querying dbt metrics, importing definitions, surfacing the underlying data in partner tools, and leveraging the dbt Server. 

For information on the partner integrations, their documentation, and more &mdash; refer to the [dbt Semantic Layer integrations](https://www.getdbt.com/product/semantic-layer-integrations) page.
