# Available integrations

A wide variety of data applications across the modern data stack natively integrate with the dbt Semantic Layer and dbt metrics &mdash; from Business Intelligence tools to notebooks, data catalogs, and more.

There are two categories of partner integrations: 

-  **dbt Semantic Layer partners** - Semantic Layer integrations are capable of interactively querying dbt metrics, surfacing the underlying data in partner tools. This refers to a group of dbt Labs partners who have full end-to-end integrations with the dbt Semantic Layer and leverage the dbt Server. 

-  **Metrics Ready partners** - Metrics Ready integrations facilitate building, discovery, and collaborating on dbt metric definitions.

For information on the different integration partners, their documentation, and more, review the [dbt Semantic Layer integrations](https://www.getdbt.com/product/semantic-layer-integrations) page.
