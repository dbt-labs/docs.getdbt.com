The dbt Semantic Layer, powered by [MetricFlow](/docs/build/about-metricflow), simplifies the process of defining and using critical business metrics, like¬†`revenue` in the modeling layer (your dbt project). By centralizing metric definitions, data teams can ensure consistent self-service access to these metrics in downstream data tools and applications. The dbt Semantic Layer eliminates duplicate coding by allowing data teams to define metrics on top of existing models and automatically handles data joins. 

Moving metric definitions out of the BI layer and into the modeling layer allows data teams to feel confident that different business units are working from the same metric definitions, regardless of their tool of choice. If a metric definition changes in dbt, it‚Äôs refreshed everywhere it‚Äôs invoked and creates consistency across all applications.

<LegacyInfo />

The dbt Semantic Layer allows your data teams to centrally define essential business metrics like¬†`revenue`,¬†`customer`, and `churn` in the modeling layer (your dbt project) for consistent self-service within downstream data tools like BI and metadata management solutions. The dbt Semantic Layer provides the flexibility to define metrics on top of your existing models and then query those metrics and models in your analysis tools of choice.

Resulting in less duplicate coding for data teams and more consistency for data consumers. 

The dbt Semantic Layer has these main parts:

- Define your metrics in version-controlled dbt project code using [MetricFlow](/docs/build/about-metricflow) 
	* dbt_metrics is now deprecated
- Import your metric definitions using the [Discovery API](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/discovery-api)
- Query your metric data with the dbt Proxy Server
- Explore and analyze dbt metrics in downstream tools

### What makes the dbt Semantic Layer different?

The dbt Semantic Layer reduces code duplication and inconsistency regarding your business metrics. By moving metric definitions out of the BI layer and into the modeling layer, your data teams can feel confident that different business units are working from the same metric definitions, regardless of their tool of choice. If a metric definition changes in dbt, it‚Äôs refreshed everywhere it‚Äôs invoked and creates consistency across all applications. You can also use the dbt Semantic Layer to query models and use macros.

## Manage metrics

:::info üìå

New to dbt or metrics? Check out our [quickstart guide](/quickstarts) to build your first dbt project! If you'd like to define your first metrics, try our [Jaffle Shop](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop_metrics) example project.

:::

If you're not sure whether to define a metric in dbt or not, ask yourself the following: 

> *Is this something our teams consistently need to report on?*  

An important business metric should be:

- Well-defined (the definition is agreed upon throughout the entire organization)
- Time-bound (able to be compared across time)

A great example of this is **revenue**. It can be aggregated on multiple levels (weekly, monthly, and so on) and is key for the broader business to understand.

- ‚úÖ `Monthly recurring revenue` or `Weekly active users` or `Average order value` 
- ‚ùå `1-off experimental metric`


### Design and define metrics

You can design and define your metrics in `.yml` files nested under a metrics key in your dbt project. For more information, refer to these docs: <br />

- [dbt metrics](docs/build/metrics) for in-depth detail on attributes, filters, how to define and query your metrics, and [dbt-metrics package](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt_metrics)
- [dbt Semantic Layer quickstart](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/quickstart-semantic-layer) to get started

  <div>
    <div>If you're using the legacy Semantic Layer, we highly recommend you <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-core-in-cloud">upgrade your dbt version </a> to dbt v1.6 or higher to use the new dbt Semantic Layer.

  <summary>How are you storing my data?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>The dbt Semantic Layer doesn't store, cache, or log your data. On each query to the Semantic Layer, the resulting data passes through dbt Cloud servers where it's never stored, cached, or logged. The data from your data platform gets routed through dbt Cloud servers to your connecting data tool.</div>

  <summary>Is the dbt Semantic Layer open source?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>Some components of the dbt Semantic Layer are open source like dbt-core, the dbt_metrics package, and the BSL-licensed dbt-server. The dbt Proxy Server (what is actually compiling the dbt code) and the Discovery API are not open source. <br></br><br></br>
