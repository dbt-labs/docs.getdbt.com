:::info Coming soon
The dbt Semantic Layer is undergoing a [significant revamp](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-semantic-layer-whats-next/), making it more efficient to define and query metrics.

**What‚Äôs changing?** The dbt_metrics package will be [deprecated](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/deprecating-dbt-metrics) and replaced with [MetricFlow](/docs/build/about-metricflow?version=1.6), a new way framework for defining metrics in dbt.

**What's new?**  Learn how to [Build your metrics](/docs/build/build-metrics-intro?version=1.6) using MetricFlow, one of the key components that makes up the revamped dbt Semantic Layer. It handles SQL query construction and defines the specification for dbt semantic models and metrics. 
:::

The dbt Semantic Layer allows data teams to centrally define essential business metrics like¬†`revenue`,¬†`customer`, and `churn` in the modeling layer (your dbt project) for consistent self-service within downstream data tools like BI and metadata management solutions. The dbt Semantic Layer provides the flexibility to define metrics on top of your existing models and then query those metrics and models in your analysis tools of choice.

The result? You have less duplicate coding for data teams and more consistency for data consumers. 

The dbt Semantic Layer has four main parts:

- Define your metrics in version-controlled dbt project code using MetricFlow
- Import your metric definitions via the [Discovery API](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/discovery-api)
- Query your metric data via the dbt Proxy Server
- Explore and analyze dbt metrics in downstream tools

### What makes the dbt Semantic Layer different?

The dbt Semantic Layer reduces code duplication and inconsistency regarding your business metrics. By moving metric definitions out of the BI layer and into the modeling layer, data teams can feel confident that different business units are working from the same metric definitions, regardless of their tool of choice. If a metric definition changes in dbt, it‚Äôs refreshed everywhere it‚Äôs invoked and creates consistency across all applications. You can also use the dbt Semantic Layer to query models and use macros.


## Prerequisites
To use the dbt Semantic Layer, you‚Äôll need to meet the following:

<Snippet path="sl-prerequisites" />

<Snippet path="sl-considerations-banner" />

## Public Preview

The dbt Semantic Layer is currently available for Public Preview, which means:

&mdash; **Who?** The dbt Semantic Layer is open to all dbt Cloud tiers (Developer, Team, and Enterprise) during Public Preview. Review [Product architecture](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/dbt-semantic-layer#product-architecture) for more info on plan availability.

- Team and Enterprise accounts will be able to set up the Semantic Layer and [Discovery API](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/discovery-api) in the integrated
partner tool to import metric definition.
- Developer accounts will be able to query the Proxy Server using SQL, but will not be able to browse dbt metrics in external tools, which requires access to the Discovery API. 

&mdash; **What?** Public Previews provide early access to new features. The Semantic Layer is stable and you can use it for production deployments, but there may still be some planned additions and modifications to product behaviors before moving to General Availability. We may also introduce new functionality that is not backwards compatible. dbt Labs provides support, and relevant service level objectives (SLOs) apply. We will introduce pricing for the dbt Semantic Layer alongside the General Available (GA) release (future GA date to be announced).
    
&mdash; **When?** Public Preview will end once the dbt Semantic Layer is available for GA. After GA, the dbt Semantic Layer will only be available to dbt Cloud **Team** and **Enterprise** plans.

&mdash; **Where?** Public Preview is enabled at the account level so you don‚Äôt need to worry about enabling it per user.

## Product architecture 

The dbt Semantic Layer product architecture includes four primary components:

| Components | Information | Developer plans | Team plans | Enterprise plans | License |
| --- | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| **[dbt project](/docs/build/metrics)** | Define models and metrics in dbt Core. | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |  ‚úÖ  | Open source, Core |
| **[dbt Server](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-server)**| A persisted HTTP server that wraps dbt core to handle RESTful API requests for dbt operations. | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | BSL |
| **SQL Proxy** | Reverse-proxy that accepts dbt-SQL (SQL + Jinja like query models and metrics, use macros), compiles the query into pure SQL, and executes the query against the data platform. | ‚úÖ <br></br>_* Available during Public Preview only_ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Proprietary, Cloud (Team & Enterprise) |
| **[Discovery API](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/discovery-api)**  | Accesses metric definitions primarily via integrations and is the source of truth for objects defined in dbt projects (like models, macros, sources, metrics). The Discovery API is updated at the end of every dbt Cloud run. | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Proprietary, Cloud (Team & Enterprise |
    
<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/semantic-layer/sl-architecture-flow.png" title="dbt Semantic components" />

dbt Semantic Layer integrations will:

- Leverage the Discovery API to fetch a list of objects and their attributes, like metrics
- Generate a dbt-SQL statement
- Then query the SQL proxy to evaluate the results of this statement


## Manage metrics

:::info üìå

New to dbt or metrics? Check out our [quickstart guide](/quickstarts) to build your first dbt project! If you'd like to define your first metrics, try our [Jaffle Shop](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop_metrics) example project.

:::

If you're not sure whether to define a metric in dbt or not, ask yourself the following: 

> *Is this something our teams consistently need to report on?*  

An important business metric should be:

- Well-defined (the definition is agreed upon throughout the entire organization)
- Time-bound (able to be compared across time)

A great example of this is **revenue** &mdash; it can be aggregated on multiple levels (weekly, monthly, etc) and is key for the broader business to understand.

- ‚úÖ `Monthly recurring revenue` or `Weekly active users` or `Average order value` 
- ‚ùå `1-off experimental metric`


### Design and define metrics

**Design metrics**
To read about best practices on structuring and organizing your metrics, review our [How to design and structure dbt metrics: Recommendations for getting started](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/how-to-design-and-structure-metrics) blog post first.

**Define metrics**
You can define your metrics in `.yml` files nested under a metrics key and to design or define your own metrics in your dbt project, review the following documents: <br />

- [How to design and structure dbt metrics: Recommendations for getting started](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/how-to-design-and-structure-metrics) blog to understand best practices for designing and structuring metrics in your dbt project
- [dbt metrics](docs/build/metrics) for in-depth detail on attributes, filters, how to define and query your metrics and [dbt-metrics package](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt_metrics)
- [dbt Semantic Layer quickstart](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/quickstart-semantic-layer) to get started

  <summary>How are you storing my data?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>The dbt Semantic Layer does not store, or cache, or log your data. On each query to the Semantic Layer, the resulting data passes through dbt Cloud servers where it is never stored, cached, or logged. The data from your data platform gets routed through dbt Cloud servers, to your connecting data tool.</div>
