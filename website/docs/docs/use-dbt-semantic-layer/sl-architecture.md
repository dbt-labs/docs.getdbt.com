The dbt Semantic Layer allows you to define metrics and use various interfaces to query them. The Semantic Layer does the heavy lifting to find where the queried data exists in your data platform and generates the SQL to make the request (including performing joins).

## dbt Semantic Layer components

The dbt Semantic Layer includes the following components:


| Components | Information | dbt Core users | Developer plans |  Team plans | Enterprise plans | License |
| --- | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| **[MetricFlow](/docs/build/about-metricflow)** | MetricFlow in dbt allows users to centrally define their semantic models and metrics with YAML specifications. | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |  ✅  | BSL package (code is source available) |
| **MetricFlow Server**| A proprietary server that takes metric requests and generates optimized SQL for the specific data platform. | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | Proprietary, Cloud (Team & Enterprise)|
| **Semantic Layer Gateway** | A service that passes queries to the MetricFlow server and executes the SQL generated by MetricFlow against the data platform| <br></br>❌ | ❌ |✅ | ✅ | Proprietary, Cloud (Team & Enterprise) |
| **Semantic Layer APIs** | The interfaces allow users to submit metric queries using GraphQL and JDBC APIs. They also serve as the foundation for building first-class integrations with various tools. | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | Proprietary, Cloud (Team & Enterprise)|

  <summary>How do I migrate from the legacy Semantic Layer to the new one?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>If you're using the legacy Semantic Layer, we highly recommend you <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-core-in-cloud">upgrade your dbt version </a> to dbt v1.6 or higher to use the new dbt Semantic Layer. Refer to the dedicated <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/migration/sl-migration"> migration guide</a> for more info.</div>

<summary>How are you storing my data?</summary>
User data passes through the Semantic Layer on its way back from the warehouse. dbt Labs ensures security by authenticating through the customer's data warehouse. Currently, we don't cache data for the long term, but it might temporarily stay in the system for up to 10 minutes, usually less. In the future, we'll introduce a caching feature that allows us to cache data on our infrastructure for up to 24 hours.

<summary>Is the dbt Semantic Layer open source?</summary>
The dbt Semantic Layer is proprietary, however, some components of the dbt Semantic Layer are open source, like dbt-core and MetricFlow. <br /><br />The universal dbt Semantic Layer is available to all Team and Enterprise Plans during public beta. Users on dbt Cloud Developer plans or dbt Core users can use MetricFlow to only define and test metrics locally.</details>

    <summary>Is there a dbt Semantic Layer discussion hub?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>Yes absolutely! Join the <a href="https://getdbt.slack.com">dbt Slack community</a> and <a href="https://getdbt.slack.com/archives/C046L0VTVR6">#dbt-cloud-semantic-layer slack channel</a> for all things related to the dbt Semantic Layer.

## Product architecture 

The dbt Semantic Layer product architecture includes four primary components:

| Components | Information | Developer plans | Team plans | Enterprise plans | License |
| --- | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| **[dbt project](/docs/build/metrics)** | Define models and metrics in dbt Core. <br /> *Note, we will deprecate and no longer support the dbt_metrics package. | ✅ | ✅ |  ✅  | Open source, Core |
| **[dbt Server](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-server)**| A persisted HTTP server that wraps dbt core to handle RESTful API requests for dbt operations. | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | BSL |
| **SQL Proxy** | Reverse-proxy that accepts dbt-SQL (SQL + Jinja like query models and metrics, use macros), compiles the query into pure SQL, and executes the query against the data platform. | ✅ <br></br>_* Available during Public Preview only_ | ✅ | ✅ | Proprietary, Cloud (Team & Enterprise) |
| **[Discovery API](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/discovery-api)**  | Accesses metric definitions primarily via integrations and is the source of truth for objects defined in dbt projects (like models, macros, sources, metrics). The Discovery API is updated at the end of every dbt Cloud run. | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | Proprietary, Cloud (Team & Enterprise) |
    
<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/semantic-layer/sl-architecture-flow.png" title="dbt Semantic components" />

dbt Semantic Layer integrations will:

- Leverage the Discovery API to fetch a list of objects and their attributes, like metrics
- Generate a dbt-SQL statement
- Then query the SQL proxy to evaluate the results of this statement
