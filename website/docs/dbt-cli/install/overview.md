## About dbt adapters

dbt works with a number of different databases, query engines, and other SQL-speaking technologies. It does this by using a dedicated _adapter_ for each. When you install dbt, you'll also want to install the specific adapter for your database. For more details, see the [list of available adapters](available-adapters).
