By v1.0.0, dbt Core and all adapter plugins maintained by dbt Labs will be available as official Docker images,
and available from a public registry.
We recommend you use Docker to install in production because it includes dbt Core and all of its dependencies. You might might also use a Docker to install and develop locally if you don't have your python environment set up.

More information coming soon!
