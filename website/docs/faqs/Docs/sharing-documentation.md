If you're using dbt Cloud to deploy your project and have the [Team or Enterprise plan](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing/), you can use dbt Explorer to view your project's [resources](/docs/build/projects) (such as models, tests, and metrics) and their <Term id="data-lineage">lineage</Term> to gain a better understanding of its latest production state. 

Access dbt Explorer in dbt Cloud by clicking the **Explore** link in the navigation. You can have up to 5 read-only users access the documentation for your project.

dbt Cloud developer and dbt Core users can use [dbt Docs](/docs/collaborate/build-and-view-your-docs#dbt-docs), a legacy feature that generates basic documentation, but it doesn't offer the same speed, metadata, or visibility as dbt Explorer.
