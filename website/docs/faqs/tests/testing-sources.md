title: How do I run tests on just my sources?
Description: “Use the select source command to test sources"
sidebar_label: 'Run tests on all sources'
id: testing-sources

To run tests on all sources, use the following command:

```
$ dbt test --select source:*
```
(You can also use the `-s` shorthand here instead of `--select`)

To run tests on one source (and all of its tables):

```
$ dbt test --select source:jaffle_shop
```

And, to run tests on one source <Term id="table" /> only:

```
$ dbt test --select source:jaffle_shop.orders
```

Yep, we know this syntax is a little less than ideal, so we're hoping to improve it in a future release. Check out the [model selection syntax](node-selection/syntax) for more examples!
