* **Jaffle Shop:** A demonstration project (closely related to the tutorial) for a fictional ecommerce store ([source code](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/jaffle_shop))

* **GitLab:** Gitlab's internal dbt project is open source and is a great example of how to use dbt at scale ([source code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/tree/master/transform/snowflake-dbt), [docs](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/))

If you have an example project to add to this list, suggest an [edit](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/docs.getdbt.com/edit/master/website/docs/faqs/example-projects.md).
