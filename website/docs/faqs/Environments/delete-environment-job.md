5. Confirm your action in the **Confirm Delete** pop-up by clicking **Confirm Delete** in the bottom right to delete the job immediately. This action cannot be undone. However, you can create a new job with the same information if the deletion was made in error. 

Refresh the page, and the deleted job should now be gone. If you want to delete multiple jobs, you'll need to perform these steps for each job.
