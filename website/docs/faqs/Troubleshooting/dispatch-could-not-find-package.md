If a package name is included in the `search_order` of a project-level `dispatch` config, dbt expects that package to contain macros which are viable candidates for dispatching. If an included package does not contain _any_ macros, dbt will raise an error like:

```shell
Compilation Error
  In dispatch: Could not find package 'my_project'
```

This does not mean the package or root project is missingâ€”it means that any macros from it are missing, and so it is missing from the search spaces available to `dispatch`.
