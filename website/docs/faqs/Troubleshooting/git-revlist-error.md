If you're unable to access the IDE due to the below error message, we'll do our best to get you unstuck with the below steps!

```shell
git rev-list master..origin/main --count
fatal: ambiguous argument 'master..origin/main': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
Use '--' to separate paths from revisions, like this:
'git <command> [<revision>...] -- [<file>...]'
```

Usually this error indicates that the "main" branch name has changed or it is possible that dbt Cloud was unable to determine what your primary branch was. No worries, we have a few workarounds for you to try:

**Workaround 1**
Take a look at your Environment Settings - If you **do not** have a custom branch filled in your Environment Settings:

1. Disconnect and reconnect your repository [connection](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/cloud-import-a-project-by-git-url) on your Project Settings page. This should then allow dbt Cloud to pick up that the "main" branch is now called `main`
2. In the Environment Settings, set the custom branch to 'master' and refresh the IDE 

**Workaround 2**
Take a look at your Environment Settings - If you **do** have a custom branch filled in your Environment Settings:

1. Disconnecting and reconnecting your repository [connection](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/cloud-import-a-project-by-git-url) on your Project Settings page. This should then allow dbt Cloud to pick up that the "main" branch is now called `main`
2. In the Environment Settings, remove the custom branch and refresh the IDE
