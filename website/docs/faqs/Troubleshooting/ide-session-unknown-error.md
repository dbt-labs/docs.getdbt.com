If you're seeing the following error when you launch the dbt Cloud IDE, it could be due to a few scenarios but, commonly, it indicates a missing repository:

```shell

Your IDE session experienced an unknown error and was terminated. Please contact support

```

To resolve this, we recommend adding a repository like a [managed repository](/docs/collaborate/git/managed-repository) or your preferred Git account by navigating to Project > Repository and selecting your repository.


If you've tried the steps above and are still experiencing this behavior - reach out to the Support team at support@getdbt.com and we'll be happy to help.
