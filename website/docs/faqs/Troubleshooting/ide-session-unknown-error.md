If you're experiencing the below error when you try to open the cloud IDE, it may be due to a few scenarios but it typically indicates a missing repository.

```shell

Your IDE session experienced an unknown error and was terminated. Please contact support

```

To resolve this, we recommend adding a repository like a [managed repository](/docs/collaborate/git/managed-repository) or your preferred Git account by navigating to Project > Repository and selecting your repository.


If you've tried the steps above and are still experiencing this behavior - reach out to the Support team at support@getdbt.com and we'll be happy to help.
