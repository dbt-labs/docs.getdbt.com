If you're seeing the following error when you launch the dbt Cloud IDE, it could be due to a few scenarios but, commonly, it indicates a missing repository:

```shell

Your IDE session experienced an unknown error and was terminated. Please contact support.

```

You can try to resolve this by adding a repository like a [managed repository](/docs/collaborate/git/managed-repository) or your preferred Git account. To add your Git account, navigate to **Project** > **Repository** and select your repository.


If you're still running into this error, please contact the Support team at support@getdbt.com for help.
