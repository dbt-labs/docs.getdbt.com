<VersionBlock firstVersion="1.5">

Once upon a time, the structure of these `.yml` files was very different (s/o to anyone who was using dbt back then!). Adding `version: 2` allowed us to make this structure more extensible.

Resource yml files do not currently require this config. We only support `version: 2` if it's specified. Although we do not expect to update yml files to `version: 3` soon, having this config will make it easier for us to introduce new structures in the future
