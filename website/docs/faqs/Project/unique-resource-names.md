Within one project: yes! To build dependencies between resources (such as models, seeds, and snapshots), you need to use the `ref` function, and pass in the resource name as an argument. dbt uses that resource name to uniquely resolve the `ref` to a specific resource. As a result, these resource names need to be unique, _even if they are in distinct folders_.

A resource in one project can have the same name as a resource in another project (installed as a dependency). dbt uses the project name to uniquely identify each resource. We call this "namespacing." If you `ref` a resource with a duplicated name, it will resolve to the resource within the same namespace (package or project), or raise an error because of an ambiguous reference. Use [two-argument `ref`](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/ref#ref-project-specific-models) to disambiguate references by specifying the namespace.

Those resource will still need to land in distinct locations in the data warehouse. Read the docs on [custom aliases](/docs/build/custom-aliases) and [custom schemas](/docs/build/custom-schemas) for details on how to achieve this.
