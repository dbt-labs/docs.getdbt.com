Yes!

* **Getting Started Tutorial:** You can build your own example dbt project in the [Getting Started guide](/docs/get-started/getting-started/getting-started-dbt-cloud)
* **Jaffle Shop:** A demonstration project (closely related to the tutorial) for a fictional ecommerce store ([source code](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop))
* **MRR Playbook:** A demonstration project that models subscription revenue ([source code](https://github.com/dbt-labs/mrr-playbook), [docs](https://www.getdbt.com/mrr-playbook/#!/overview))
* **Attribution Playbook:** A demonstration project that models marketing attribution  ([source code](https://github.com/dbt-labs/attribution-playbook), [docs](https://www.getdbt.com/attribution-playbook/#!/overview))
* **GitLab:** Gitlab's internal dbt project is open source and is a great example of how to use dbt at scale ([source code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/tree/master/transform/snowflake-dbt), [docs](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/))
