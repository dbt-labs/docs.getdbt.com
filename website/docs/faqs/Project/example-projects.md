Yes!

* **Quickstart Tutorial:** You can build your own example dbt project in the [quickstart guide](/docs/get-started-dbt)
* **Jaffle Shop:** A demonstration project (closely related to the tutorial) for a fictional e-commerce store ([main source code](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle-shop) and [source code using duckdb](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop_duckdb))
* **GitLab:** Gitlab's internal dbt project is open source and is a great example of how to use dbt at scale ([source code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/tree/master/transform/snowflake-dbt))
* **dummy-dbt:** A containerized dbt project that populates the Sakila database in Postgres and populates dbt seeds, models, snapshots, and tests. The project can be used for testing and experimentation purposes ([source code](https://github.com/gmyrianthous/dbt-dummy))
* **Google Analytics 4:** A demonstration project that transforms the Google Analytics 4 BigQuery exports to various models ([source code](https://github.com/stacktonic-com/stacktonic-dbt-example-project), [docs](https://stacktonic.com/article/google-analytics-big-query-and-dbt-a-dbt-example-project))
* **Make Open Data:**  A production grade ELT with tests, documentation and CI/CD (GHA) about french open data (housing, demography, geography, etc). Can be used to learn with voluminous and ambiguous data. Contributions are welcome ([source code](https://github.com/make-open-data/make-open-data), [docs](https://make-open-data.fr/))
