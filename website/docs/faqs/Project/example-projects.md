Yes!

* **Quickstart Tutorial:** You can build your own example dbt project in the [quickstart guide](/docs/quickstarts/overview)
* **Jaffle Shop:** A demonstration project (closely related to the tutorial) for a fictional ecommerce store ([source code](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop))
* **MRR Playbook:** A demonstration project that models subscription revenue ([source code](https://github.com/dbt-labs/mrr-playbook), [docs](https://www.getdbt.com/mrr-playbook/#!/overview))
* **Attribution Playbook:** A demonstration project that models marketing attribution  ([source code](https://github.com/dbt-labs/attribution-playbook), [docs](https://www.getdbt.com/attribution-playbook/#!/overview))
* **GitLab:** Gitlab's internal dbt project is open source and is a great example of how to use dbt at scale ([source code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/tree/master/transform/snowflake-dbt), [docs](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/))
* **dummy-dbt:** A containerized dbt project that populates the Sakila database in Postgres and populates dbt seeds, models, snapshots, and tests. The project can be used for testing and experimentation purposes ([source code](https://github.com/gmyrianthous/dbt-dummy))
