It's up to you:
- Some folks find it useful to have one file per model (or source / snapshot / seed etc)
- Some find it useful to have one per directory, documenting and testing multiple models in one file

Choose what works for your team. We have more recommendations in our guide on [structuring dbt projects](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview).
