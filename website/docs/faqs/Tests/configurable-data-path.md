<Changelog>

- **v1.0.0:** The config 'data-paths' has been deprecated in favor of [`seed-paths`](/reference/project-configs/seed-paths).

</Changelog>

By default, dbt expects your seed files to be located in the `seeds` subdirectory
of your project.

To change this, update the [seed-paths](reference/project-configs/seed-paths.md) configuration in your `dbt_project.yml`
file, like so:

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yml
seed-paths: ["custom_seeds"]
```

</File>
