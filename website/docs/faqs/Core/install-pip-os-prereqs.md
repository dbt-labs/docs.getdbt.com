Your operating system may require pre-installation setup before installing dbt Core with pip. After downloading and installing any dependencies specific to your development environment, you can proceed with the [pip installation of dbt Core](/docs/core/pip-install).

### CentOS

CentOS requires Python and some other dependencies to successfully install and run dbt Core.

To install Python and other dependencies:

```shell

sudo yum install redhat-rpm-config gcc libffi-devel \
  python-devel openssl-devel

```

### MacOS

The MacOS requires Python 3.7 or higher to successfully install and run dbt Core.

To check the Python version:

```shell

python --version

```

If you need a compatible version, you can download and install [Python version 3.7 or higher for MacOS](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos).

If your machine runs on an Apple M1 architecture, we recommend that you install dbt via [Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861). This is necessary for certain dependencies that are only supported on Intel processors.
### Ubuntu/Debian

Ubuntu requires Python and other dependencies to successfully install and run dbt Core.

To install Python and other dependencies:

```shell

sudo apt-get install git libpq-dev python-dev python3-pip
sudo apt-get remove python-cffi
sudo pip install --upgrade cffi
pip install cryptography~=3.4

```

#### Windows

Windows requires Python and git to successfully install and run dbt Core.

Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Python version 3.7 or higher for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
