If you're receiving an 'Account in use' error when trying to integrate GitHub in your Profile page, this is because the Git integration is a 1-to-1 integration, so you can only have your Git account linked to one dbt Cloud user account. 

Here are some steps to take to get you unstuck:

* Log in to the dbt Cloud account integrated with your Git account. Go to your user profile and click on Integrations to remove the link.

If you don't remember which dbt Cloud account is integrated, please email dbt Support at support@getdbt.com and we'll do our best to disassociate the integration for you.
