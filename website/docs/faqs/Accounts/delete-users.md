To delete a user in dbt Cloud, you must be an account owner or have admin privileges. If the user has a `developer` license type, this will open up their seat for another user or allow the admins to lower the total number of seats. 

1. From dbt Cloud, click the gear icon at the top right and select **Account Settings**.

2. In **Account Settings**, select **Users** under **Teams**.
3. Select the user you want to delete, then click **Edit**. 
4. Click **Delete** in the bottom left. Click **Confirm Delete** to immediately delete the user without additional password prompts. This action cannot be undone. However, you can re-invite the user with the same information if the deletion was made in error.

If you are on a **Teams** plan and you are deleting users to reduce the number of billable seats, you also need to take these steps to lower the license count:
1. In **Account Settings**, select **Billing**. 
2. Enter the number of developer seats you want and click **Save**.
