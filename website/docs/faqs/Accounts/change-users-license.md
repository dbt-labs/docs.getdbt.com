To change the license type for a user from `developer` to `read-only` or `IT` in dbt Cloud, you must be an account owner or have admin privileges. You might make this change to free up a billable seat but retain the user’s access to view the information in the dbt Cloud account.

1. From dbt Cloud, click the gear icon at the top right and select **Account Settings**.

2. In **Account Settings**, select **Users** under **Teams**.
3. Select the user you want to remove, and click **Edit** in the bottom of their profile.
4. For the **License** option, choose **Read-only** or **IT** (from **Developer**), and click **Save**.
