To change the license type for a user from `developer` to `read-only` in dbt Cloud, you must be an account owner or have admin privileges. You might make this change to free up a billable seat but retain the userâ€™s access to view the information in the dbt Cloud account.

1. From dbt Cloud, click the gear icon at the top right and select **Account Settings**.

3. Select the user you want to remove, and click **Edit** in the bottom of their profile.
4. For the **License** option, choose **Read-only** (from **Developer**), and click **Save**.
