## How to upgrade your dbt Cloud Account

Once your dbt Cloud trial ends or if your subscription payment is past due, you'll need to perform a plan upgrade in order to continue using your account.

**Note**: Only users that are part of the "Owner" user group have the ability to make these changes. Users not included in this group will not see these options in the UI. 

Upon logging in, you will be prompted with an "Account Locked" message, with a button at the bottom that says "Go to Billing". Click this button.

This will redirect you to the billing page. Under "Plan Details" you'll have the option to select which plan you'd like to enroll in. Click "Select Plan Now".

On the next page you'll be able to select from our plan tiers: Developer, Team, and Enterprise. You can learn more about each of these options [here](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing/).
