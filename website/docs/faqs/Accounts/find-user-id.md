Knowing your dbt Cloud user ID can help with interacting with support. 

To find your user ID in dbt Cloud, read the following steps:

1. Go to **Account Settings**, **Team**, and then **Users**,
2. Select your user, <br />
3. In the address bar, the number after `/users` is your user ID. 
4. Copy that number or save it somewhere safe. <br />

For example, if the URL is `https://YOUR_ACCESS_URL/settings/accounts/12345/users/67891` &mdash; the user ID is `67891`<br /><br />
