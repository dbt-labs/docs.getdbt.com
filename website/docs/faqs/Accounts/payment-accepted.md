Presently for Team plans, self-service dbt Cloud payments must be made via credit card and by default, they will be billed monthly based on the number of [active developer seats and usage](/docs/cloud/billing).

We don't have any plans to do invoicing for self-service teams in the near future, but we *do* currently support invoices for companies on the **dbt Cloud Enterprise plan.** Feel free to [contact us](https://www.getdbt.com/contact) to build your Enterprise pricing.
