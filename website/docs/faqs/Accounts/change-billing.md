If you want to change your account's credit card details, select the gear menu in the upper right corner of dbt Cloud. Go to Account Settings  &#8594; Billing  &#8594; Payment Information. In the upper right corner of Payment Information, click **Edit** to enter the new credit card details. Only the _account owner_ can make this change. 

To change your billing name or location address, send our Support team a message at support@getdbt.com with the newly updated information, and we can make that change for you!
