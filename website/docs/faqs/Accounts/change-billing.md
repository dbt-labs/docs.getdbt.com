To change your billing name, address, or email, just send us a message at support@getdbt.com with the newly updated information, and we can make that change for you! 

If you'd like to change card details, the account owner can do this by clicking the  ![hamburger icon](/img/hamburger-icon.png), then click **Account Settings**, then **Billing**.
