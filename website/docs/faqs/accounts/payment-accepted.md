title: Can I pay via invoice?
---
Presently for Team plans, self-service dbt Cloud payments must be made via credit card and by default, they will be billed monthly based on the number of active developer seats.

We don’t have any plans to do invoicing for self-service teams in the near future, but we *do* currently support invoices for companies on the **dbt Cloud Enterprise plan.** Feel free to [contact us](https://www.getdbt.com/contact) to build your Enterprise pricing.
