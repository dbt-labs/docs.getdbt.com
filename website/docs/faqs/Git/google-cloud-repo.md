Although we don't officially support Google Cloud as a git repository, the below workaround using the SSH URL method should help you to connect:

- First: "import" your Repository into dbt Cloud using the SSH URL provided to you by GCP. That will look something like: 
`ssh://drew@fishtownanalytics.com@source.developers.google.com:2022/p/dbt-integration-tests/r/drew-debug`

- After importing the repo, you should see a public key generated by dbt Cloud for the repository. You'll want to copy that public key into a new SSH Key for your user here: [https://source.cloud.google.com/user/ssh_keys](https://source.cloud.google.com/user/ssh_keys)

- After saving this SSH key, dbt Cloud should be able to read and write to this repo.

If you've tried the workaround above and are still having issues connecting - reach out to the Support team at support@getdbt.com and we'll be happy to help!
