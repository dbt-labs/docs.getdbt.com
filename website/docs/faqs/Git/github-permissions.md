If you see the error `This account needs to accept the latest permissions for the dbt Cloud GitHub App` in dbt Cloud &mdash; this usually occurs when the permissions for the dbt Cloud GitHub App are out of date.

To solve this issue, you'll need to update the permissions for the dbt Cloud GitHub App in your GitHub account. Here's a couple of ways you can do it:

#### Update permissions

A GitHub organization admin will need to update the permissions in GitHub for the dbt Cloud GitHub App. If you're not the admin, reach out to your organization admin to request this. 

1. Navigate to your GitHub account. Click on the top right profile icon and then **Settings** (or personal if using a non-organization account).

2. Then go to **Integrations** and then select **Applications** to identify any necessary permission changes. Note that a GitHub repository admin may not see the same permission request.

3. Click on **Review request** and then click on the **Accept new permissions** button on the next page.

For more info on GitHub permissions, refer to [access permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/access-permissions-on-github).

Alternatively, try [disconecting your GitHub account](#disconect-github) in dbt Cloud, detailed in the following section.
