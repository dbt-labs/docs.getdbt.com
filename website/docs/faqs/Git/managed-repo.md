dbt Labs can send your managed repository through a ZIP file in its current state for you to push up to a git provider. After that, you'd just need to switch over to the [repo in your project](/docs/cloud/git/import-a-project-by-git-url) to point to the new repository.

When you're ready to do this, [contact the dbt Labs Support team](mailto:support@getdbt.com) with your request and your managed repo URL, which you can find by navigating to your project setting. To find project settings, click the gear icon in the upper right, select **Account settings**, click **Projects**, and then select your project. Under **Repository** in the project details page, you can find your managed repo URL.
