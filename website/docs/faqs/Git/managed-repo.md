We can absolutely send your managed repository through a zip file in its current state for you to push up to a git provider. After that, you'd just need to switch over the repo in your [Project](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/cloud-import-a-project-by-git-url)to point to the new repository.

When you're ready to do this, email our Support team at support@getdbt.com with your request and your managed repo URL - you can find this by clicking the hamburger menu > Accounts settings.
