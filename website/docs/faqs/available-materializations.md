title: What materializations are available in dbt?
---

dbt ships with four materializations: `view`, `table`, `incremental` and `ephemeral`. Check out the documentation on [materializations](materializations) for more information on each of these options.

You can also create your own [custom materializations](creating-new-materializations), if required however this is an advanced feature of dbt.
