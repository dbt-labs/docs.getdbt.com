When you use the `ref` [function](dbt-jinja-functions/ref), dbt automatically infers the dependencies between models.

For example, consider a model, `customer_orders`, like so:

<File name='models/customer_orders.sql'>

```sql
select
    customer_id,
    min(order_date) as first_order_date,
    max(order_date) as most_recent_order_date,
    count(order_id) as number_of_orders
from {{ ref('stg_orders') }}
group by 1

```

</File>

**There's no need to explicitly define these dependencies.** dbt will understand that the `stg_orders` model needs to be built before the above model (`customer_orders`). When you execute `dbt run`, you will see these being built in order:

```txt
$ dbt run
