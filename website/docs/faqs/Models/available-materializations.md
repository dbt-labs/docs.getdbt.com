dbt ships with five <Term id="materialization">materializations</Term>: `view`, `table`, `incremental`, `ephemeral` and `materialized_view`.
Check out the documentation on [materializations](/docs/build/materializations) for more information on each of these options.

You can also create your own [custom materializations](/guides/create-new-materializations), if required however this is an advanced feature of dbt.
