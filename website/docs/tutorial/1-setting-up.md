description: "Create your first dbt project using a SQL query."

Learn how to turn the following SQL query into a tested, documented, and deployed dbt project. You can preview [the generated documentation](https://www.getdbt.com/getting-started-tutorial/#!/overview) for the project we're building. You'll need a working knowledge of SQL to complete this tutorial.

If you want a more in-depth learning experience, consider taking some [dbt Learn online courses](https://courses.getdbt.com/).

The project you're creating is based on a fictional business named `jaffle_shop`, so you'll see this name used throughout the project. In the Jaffle shop organization, you can use the following query to build a `customers` table.

```sql
with customers as (

    select
        id as customer_id,
        first_name,
        last_name

    from `dbt-tutorial`.jaffle_shop.customers

),

orders as (

    select
        id as order_id,
        user_id as customer_id,
        order_date,
        status

    from `dbt-tutorial`.jaffle_shop.orders

),

customer_orders as (

    select
        customer_id,

        min(order_date) as first_order_date,
        max(order_date) as most_recent_order_date,
        count(order_id) as number_of_orders

    from orders

    group by 1

),


final as (

    select
        customers.customer_id,
        customers.first_name,
        customers.last_name,
        customer_orders.first_order_date,
        customer_orders.most_recent_order_date,
        coalesce(customer_orders.number_of_orders, 0) as number_of_orders

    from customers

    left join customer_orders using (customer_id)

)

select * from final
```

## Choose the way you want to develop

Thereâ€™s two main ways of working with dbt:

1. Edit files and run projects using the web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) in **dbt Cloud**.
2. Edit files locally using a code editor, and run projects using the Command Line Interface (**dbt CLI**).

To use the CLI, it's important that you know some basics of your terminal. In particular, you should understand `cd`, `ls` and `pwd` to navigate through the directory structure of your computer easily. As such, if you are new to programming, we recommend using **dbt Cloud** for this tutorial.

If you wish to use the CLI, please follow the [installation instructions](/dbt-cli/install/overview) for your operating system.
