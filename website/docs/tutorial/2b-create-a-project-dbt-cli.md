description: Now that we're set up, let's create a starter project with example models using the dbt CLI.
---

Now that we've successfully run our sample query in BigQuery, and chosen the way we want to develop, we can create a dbt project! In this step, we'll create a starter project with example models, before we build our own models.

:::info

These are the instructions for developing a project using the dbt CLI. If you're developing in dbt Cloud, follow the instructions [here](/tutorial/create-a-project-dbt-cloud).

:::

## Create a repository
We're going to use [GitHub](https://github.com/) as our git provider for this tutorial, but you can use any git provider. If you don't yet have a GitHub account, [create one now](https://github.com/join).
<LoomVideo id="afe148aeab5e4279a2ca310251ea20a6" />

1. Create a new GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/new) named `dbt-tutorial`.
2. Click **Create repository** (without `.gitignore` and without a license).

## Create a project
<LoomVideo id="f36152340ccc41e8be517eb295c4d6f1" />

The dbt CLI comes with a command to help you scaffold a dbt project. To create your dbt project:
1. Ensure dbt is installed by running `dbt --version`:
```shell-session
$ dbt --version
```

:::info

dbt should have been installed as part of the  [Setting Up](/tutorial/setting-up) part of the tutorial. If it was not installed, please follow the [installation instructions](dbt-cli/install/overview).

:::

2. Run the `init` command:
```shell-session
$ dbt init jaffle-shop
```
3. `cd` into your project:
```shell-session
$ cd jaffle-shop
```
You can use `pwd` to confirm that you are in the right spot.

3. Open your project (i.e. the directory you just created) in a code editor like Atom or VSCode. You should see a directory structure with `.sql` and `.yml` files that were generated by the `init` command.

4. Update the following values in the `dbt_project.yml` file:

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yaml
name: jaffle_shop # this normally says my_new_project

...

profile: jaffle_shop # this normally says default

...

models:
  jaffle_shop: #this normally says my_new_project. It should match the value for `name:`
    ...
```

</File>

## Connect to BigQuery
When developing locally, dbt connects to your data warehouse using a [profile](/dbt-cli/configure-your-profile) — a yaml file with all the connection details to your warehouse.

1. Create a file in the `~/.dbt/` directory named `profiles.yml`.
2. Move your BigQuery keyfile into this directory.
3. Copy the following into the file — make sure you update the values where indicated.

<File name='profiles.yml'>

```yaml
jaffle_shop: # this needs to match the profile: in your dbt_project.yml file
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: bigquery
      method: service-account
      keyfile: /Users/claire/.dbt/dbt-user-creds.json # replace this with the full path to your keyfile
      project: grand-highway-265418 # Replace this with your project id
      dataset: dbt_alice # Replace this with dbt_your_name, e.g. dbt_bob
      threads: 1
      timeout_seconds: 300
      location: US
      priority: interactive
```

</File>

4. Execute the debug command from your project to confirm that you can successfully connect
```shell-session
$ dbt debug
```
Confirm that the last line of the output is `Connection test: OK connection ok`.

## Perform your first dbt run
Our sample project has some example models in it. We're going to check that we can run them to confirm everything is in order.

1. Execute the `run` command to build the example models:
```shell-session
$ dbt run
```
You should have an ouput that looks like this:

## Commit your changes
We need to commit our changes so that our repository has up-to-date code.
<LoomVideo id="a39753e4ce5647b2be4e5331788bab91" />

1. Link the GitHub repository you created to your dbt project by running the following commands. Make sure you use the correct git URL for your repository.
```shell-session
$ git init
$ git branch -M main
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Create a dbt project"
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/dbt-tutorial.git
$ git push -u origin main
```

If this is your first time using git, it's worth taking some time to understand the basics.
