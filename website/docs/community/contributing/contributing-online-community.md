### Maintaining a channel in the dbt Community Slack

#### What is it

The dbt Slack is the place for real time conversations with the dbt Community. Slack channels exist to for specific locations, tools, industries and methodologies. In order to make sure that every channel has dedicated attention from a committed community member, we have Community Maintainers who oversee the discussion in particular channels.

#### Contribution opportunities
  
We‚Äôre working on compiling a list of existing channels that could benefit from additional community maintainers. In the meantime, feel free to be on the lookout for opportunities to help maintain new channels that are getting spun up by keeping an eye on #channel-requests in the dbt slack.

#### Sample contributions

- Karen Hsieh's [contributions](https://getdbt.slack.com/archives/C02TU2DSKND/p1661483529756289) to the #local-taipei channel are a fantastic example to learn from.

#### How to get started

- Read the guide to [Maintaining a Slack Channel](https://docs.getdbt.com/community/maintaining-a-channel)
- Jump in to threads in #channel-requests for new channels and offer to help maintain or mention that you are interested in helping maintain a channel and we‚Äôll reach out.

### Participating on the Community Forum

#### What is it
[The dbt Community Forum](https://discourse.getdbt.com) is the preferred platform for support questions as well as a space for long-lived discussions about dbt, analytics engineering, and the analytics profession. It's a place for us to build up a long-lasting knowledge base around the common challenges, opportunities, and patterns we work with every day.
