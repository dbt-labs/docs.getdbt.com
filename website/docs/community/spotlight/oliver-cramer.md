  When I joined Aquila Capital in early 2022, I had the ModernDataStack with SqlDBM, dbt & Snowflake available. During the first half year I joined the dbt community. I have been working in the business intelligence field for many years. In 2006 I founded the first TDWI Roudtable in the DACH region. I often speak at conferences, such as the Snowflake Summit and the German TDWI conference.
  I have been very involved in the data vault community for over 20 years and I do a lot of work with dbt Labsâ€™ Sean McIntyre and Victoria Mola to promote Data Vault in EMEA. I have even travelled to Canada and China to meet data vault community members! Currently I have a group looking at the Data Vault dbt packages. The German Data Vault User Group (DDVUG) has published a sample database to test Data Warehouse Automation tools. 
  In addition, I founded the Analytics Engineering Northern Germany Meetup Group, which will transition into an official dbt Meetup, the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/norther-germany-dbt-meetup/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Northern Germany dbt Meetup</a>.

## When did you join the dbt community and in what way has it impacted your career?

I joined the dbt community in 2022. My current focus is on building modern data teams. There is no magic formula for structuring your analytics function. Given the pace of technological change in our industry, the structure of a data team must evolve over time.

## What dbt community leader do you identify with? How are you looking to grow your leadership in the dbt community?

I like working with dbt Labs' Sean McIntyre to promote Data Vault in Europe and Victoria Perez Mola, also from dbt Labs, is always a great help when I have questions about dbt.

## What have you learned from community members? What do you hope others can learn from you?

I just think it's good to have a community, to be able to ask questions and get good answers.

## Anything else interesting you want to tell us?

Data Vault is actively looking forward to supporting the messaging that dbt Cloud (+packages) is a real alternative that works.
