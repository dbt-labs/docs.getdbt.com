  I've been in the dbt community for ~4 years now. My experience is primarily in leading data teams, previously at a healthcare startup where I migrated the stack. The dbt Community was invaluable during that time. More recently I've built a product, Aero, that helps Snowflake users optimize costs with a Native extension. I'm exploring ways to automate analytics engineering workflows.

  I've spoken at various meetups, including the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/nyc-dbt-meetup/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New York dbt Meetup</a>, on data warehouse cost optimization.

## When did you join the dbt community and in what way has it impacted your career?

I joined a few years ago. It's helped me level up on best practices while making new friends and connections along the way.

## What dbt community leader do you identify with? How are you looking to grow your leadership in the dbt community?

I remember Claire Carroll early on being a great example for community mentorship. I identify with leaders who bring constructive, opinionated, experience-driven insight to conversations.

## What have you learned from community members? What do you hope others can learn from you?

I've learned lessons on scaling a large community and creating a culture of curiosity. Hoping others can learn new ways to be useful and build the courage to get themselves out thereâ€”to give talks, share their ideas, and engage in debate!

## Anything else interesting you want to tell us?

If you're not doing the basics to control costs on Snowflake, you should be! Try out [Aero Cost Optimizer](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZT1ZYS85V/aero-aero-cost-optimizer).
