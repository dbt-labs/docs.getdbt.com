  I've been a dbt Community member for around a year and a half. I come to the data world from teaching and academic research. Working in data fuses the aspects of those careers that I like the most, which are technical problem solving, and helping non-technical audiences understand data and what they can do with it. I have a dream stack with Databricks, dbt, and Looker. 

  Professionally, I help shippers of perishable goods (everything from blueberries to childhood vaccinations) understand the risks their goods face in transit and how to mitigate them.This reduces food and medical waste worldwide.

## When did you join the dbt community and in what way has it impacted your career?

I joined the dbt community early in 2022 hoping to find technical help with dbt, and instead found a wide support network of career-minded data professionals. Being in the dbt community has helped me find my niche in the data world, and has helped me discover ways I can grow my career and technical acumen. Being in this community has been huge in easing my career transition from teaching into data.

## What dbt community leader do you identify with? How are you looking to grow your leadership in the dbt community?

I primarily conceptualize of leadership as raising the floor beneath everyone, rather than enabling a few to touch its vaulted ceiling. As I gain more experience, I'd be delighted to be a resource for fellow career changers and teachers in transition. 

And, I love to goof in #roast-my-graph in the dbt Slack. [Come join](https://www.getdbt.com/community/join-the-community/?utm_medium=internal&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=q3-2024_dbt-spotlight_aw&utm_content=____&utm_term=all___) that channel, it's a hoot and a holler.

## What have you learned from community members? What do you hope others can learn from you?

I've learned a lot from community members, but most notably and concretely, I've actually gotten excellent visualization advice in #roast-my-graph. I've taken graphs there several times where I felt stuck on the presentation and have learned a lot about effective vizzes from my peers there. 

As I continue to gain experience, I hope others can learn from me what a successful career change looks like. And, ultimately, to take the work seriously but to not take ourselves that seriously.

## Anything else interesting you want to tell us?

I have a black cat with one eye named Gus and my purpose is now to give him the best existence possible.
