# Tips for organizing inclusive events

The dbt community is filled with dedicated community leaders who create opportunities for connection, learning and professional development within the analytics community.

This guide is a resource to help organizers execute **inclusive digital events**. We understand that organizers, presenters, speakers, etc. might not be able to apply these tips to *every* event, but this guide will offer some food for thought.

Additionally, this list can grow. If you would like to contribute a tip, please email [community@dbtlabs.com](mailto:community@dbtlabs.com).

## General logistics

- Try to choose a date that does not overlap with [holidays](http://www.holidayscalendar.com/months/) or general major events. Don’t forget to check international holidays (if applicable)
- Avoid really large national/local events (i.e. World Cup)

## Marketing

- If you are using photos, share images that include community members with a wide range of presentations, including people from underrepresented groups.
- Put event accessibility information on your event page (i.e. “closed captioning available for all video resources”)
- In the registration process provide an opportunity for attendees to:
    - share pronouns
    - ask questions in advance
    - request specific needs or other accommodations (interpreting services, braille transcription, dietary restrictions, etc.)
- If this is a paid event (e.g. a conference), create a scholarship for attendees that might need financial support
- Think about how you are promoting your event — are you reaching underrepresented communities, marginalized populations and people who might not have access to the internet?

## Programming

- Book diverse speakers. Include speakers that represent underrepresented and marginalized populations.
- Do research on your speakers. Is there any reason that your speakers would make the audience uncomfortable?
- Design an [accessible presentation](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/11/inclusive-design-accessible-presentations/)
- If possible, share a recording after the event for community members who are not able to make it and add closed captioning.
- Ask speakers to introduce themselves before starting their presentation, so that transcription services can capture who is talking.

## Digital platforms for online events

- Take a minute or two to explain the features of the platform that attendees will be using in the beginning of the event
- Offer the option for attendees to dial-in by phone and participate without a computer or internet
- Explore the accessibility features your platform offers and apply it where necessary (i.e. closed captioning, automatic transcripts, screen reader support, etc.)
- Check if your platform is compatible with assistive technology

## Attendee communication

- Make sure that attendees have any addresses, links, codes, numbers to accessing the event beforehand
- Share the agenda of the event beforehand so that attendees are able to make arrangements (if necessary)
- Share contact information with attendees so that they are able to reach out with questions before and after the event.
- Ask attendees for feedback in a post-event survey so that you are able to improve future experiences.

## Speaker communication

- Ask speakers how to pronounce their names before the event
- Ask speakers for their pronouns before the event
- Suggest that speakers use headphones to ensure clear audio
- Ask speakers to use plain language and avoid jargon, slang, idioms, etc.
