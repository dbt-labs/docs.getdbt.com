    <title>Working with right joins in SQL</title>
</head>

The not-as-favorite child: the right join. Unlike [left joins](/sql-reference/left-join) that return all rows in the database object in [the FROM statement](/sql-reference/from), regardless of match in the left join object, right joins return all rows *in the right join database object*, regardless of match in the database object in the FROM statement. 

What you really need to know: You can accomplish anything a right join does with a left join and left joins typically are more readable and intuitive. However, weâ€™ll still walk you through how to use right joins and elaborate on why we think left joins are superior ðŸ˜‰

## How to create a right join

Like all joins, you need some database objects (ie tables/views), keys to join on, and a [select statement](/sql-reference/select) to perform a right join:

```
select
    <fields>
from <table_1> as t1
right join <table_2> as t2
on t1.id = t2.id 
```

In this example above, thereâ€™s only one field from each table being used to join the two together together; if youâ€™re joining between two database objects that require multiple fields, you can leverage AND/OR operators, and more preferably, <Term id="surrogate-key">surrogate keys</Term>. You may additionally add [WHERE](/sql-reference/where), [GROUP BY](/sql-reference/group-by), [ORDER BY](/sql-reference/order-by), [HAVING](/sql-reference/having), and other clauses after your joins to create filtering, ordering, and performing aggregations. You may also right (or any join really) as many joins as youâ€™d like in an individual query or <Term id="cte" />.

### SQL right join example

Table A `car_type`

| **user_id** | **car_type** |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | van |
| 2 | sedan |
| 3 | truck |

Table B `car_color`

| **user_id** | **car_color** |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | red |
| 3 | green |
| 4 | yellow |

```sql
select
   car_type.user_id as user_id,
   car_type.car_type as type,
   car_color.car_color as color
from {{ ref('car_type') }} as car_type
right join {{ ref('car_color') }} as car_color
on car_type.user_id = car_color.user_id
```

This simple query will return *all* rows from Table B and adds the `color` column to rows where thereâ€™s a successful match to Table A:

| **user_id** | **type** | **color** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | van | red |
| 3 | truck | green |
| 4 | null | yellow |

Because thereâ€™s no `user_id` = 4 in Table A, there is no `type` available, thus a null result `type` column for `user_id` 4. Since no `user_id` = 2 exists in Table B, and that id is not in the right join database object, no rows with a `user_id` of 2 will be returned.

## SQL right join use cases

Compared to left joins, you likely wonâ€™t see right joins as often (or ever) in data modeling and analytics engineering work. But why not?

Simply because right joins are a little less intuitive than a left join. When youâ€™re data modeling, youâ€™re usually focused on one database object, and adding the supplementary data or tables you need to give you a final dataset. That one focal database object is typically what is put in the `from {{ ref('my_database_object')}}`; any other columns that are joined onto it from other tables are usually supplementary, but keeping all the rows from the initial table of focus is usually the priority. Donâ€™t get us wrongâ€”right joins can get you thereâ€”itâ€™s likely just a little less intuitive and can get complex with queries that involve multiple joins.
