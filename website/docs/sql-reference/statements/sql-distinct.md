</head>

Letâ€™s just put it out there: at one point in your data work, youâ€™ll encounter duplicates in your data. They may be introduced from a faulty data source or created during the joining and transforming of data. You may need a more sophisticated or refactored solution for the latter scenario, but it never hurts to know how to use DISTINCT in a query.

Using DISTINCT in a SELECT statement will force a query to only return non-duplicate rows. You may commonly see a DISTINCT clause in COUNT functions to get counts of distinct rows.

## How to use SQL DISTINCT in a query

To remove duplicate rows from a query, you add DISTINCT immediately after SELECT followed by the rows you want to be selected:

```sql
select
	distinct
	row_1,
	row_2
from my_data_source
```

Letâ€™s take a look at a practical example using DISTINCT below.

### SQL DISTINCT example

```sql
select
	count(customer_id) as cnt_all_orders,
	count(distinct customer_id) as cnt_distinct_customers
from {{ ref('orders') }}
```

This simple query is something you may do while doing initial exploration of your data; it will return the count of `customer_ids` and count of distinct `customer_ids` that appear in the [Jaffle Shopâ€™s](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop) `orders` table:

| cnt_all_orders | cnt_distinct_customers |
|:---:|:---:|
| 99 | 62 |

As you can see from the query results, there are 99 orders placed by customers, but only 62 distinct customers in the table.

## DISTINCT syntax in Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, and Redshift

Since itâ€™s a pillar of SQL, all modern data warehouses support the ability to use DISTINCT in a SELECT statement ðŸ˜€

## DISTINCT use cases

Youâ€™ll most commonly see queries using a DISTINCT statement to:

- Remove unnecessary duplicate rows from a data model; a word of caution on this: if you need to use DISTINCT in a downstream, non-source model that contains joins, thereâ€™s a chance that there could be faulty logic producing duplicates in the data, so always double-check that they are true duplicates.

- Find the counts of distinct fields in a dataset, especially for primary or surrogate keys.

This isnâ€™t an extensive list of where your team may be using DISTINCT throughout your development work, dbt models, and BI tool logic, but it contains some common scenarios analytics engineers face day-to-day.
