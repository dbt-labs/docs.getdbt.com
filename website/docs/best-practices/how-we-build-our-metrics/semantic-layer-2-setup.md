## Getting started

First, if you want to follow along, we'll need to clone the [example project](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle-sl-template). You will need access to a Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, or Postgres warehouse for this, for the time being. The project is our classic Jaffle Shop, a simulated chain restaurant serving [jaffles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_iron) and tasty beverages.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:dbt-labs/jaffle-sl-template.git
cd path/to/project
```

Next, before you start writing code, you need to install MetricFlow as an extension of a dbt adapter from PyPI  (dbt Core users only). The MetricFlow is compatible with Python versions 3.8 through 3.11.

We'll use pip to install MetricFlow and our dbt adapter:

```shell
# activate a virtual environment for your project,
# if you don't have a name you like to use we suggest .venv
python -m venv [virtual environment name]
source [virtual environment name]/bin/activate
# install dbt and MetricFlow
pip install "dbt-metricflow[adapter name]"
# e.g. pip install "dbt-metricflow[snowflake]"
```

Lastly, to get to the pre-Semantic Layer starting state, checkout the `start-here` branch.

```shell
git checkout start-here
```

For more information, refer to the [MetricFlow commands](/docs/build/metricflow-commands) or a [quickstart](/guides) to get more familiar with setting up a dbt project.

## Basic commands

- üíª This package will install both `dbt` and `mf` as CLIs in our virtual environment. All the regular `dbt` commands like `run`, `build`, and `test` are available.
- üîç A less common one that will come in handy with the Semantic Layer is `dbt parse`. This will parse your project and generate a **semantic manifest**, a representation of meaningful connections described by your project. This file gives MetricFlow a **state of the world from which to generate queries**.
- üß∞ In addition to `dbt`, you'll have access to `mf` commands like `query` and `validate-configs`, which operate based on that semantic manifest. We'll dig more into all of these as we go along.
- üõ†Ô∏è Lets start off by running a `dbt build` to get the **starting state** of our project built.
