## How to build a semantic model

A semantic model is the Semantic Layer equivalent to a logical layer model (what historically has just been called a 'model' in dbt land). Just as configurations for models are defined on the `models:` YAML key, configurations for semantic models are housed under `semantic models:`. A key difference is that while a logical model consists of configuration and SQL or Python code, a **semantic model is defined purely via YAML**. Rather than encoding a specific dataset, a **semantic model describes relationships and expressions** that let your end users select and refine their own datasets dynamically and reliably.

- ⚙️ Semantic models are **comprised of three components**:
  - 🫂 **entities**: these describe the **relationships** between various semantic models (think ids)
  - 🔪 **dimensions**: these are the columns you want to **slice, dice, group, and filter by** (think timestamps, categories, booleans).
  - 📏 **measures**: these are the **quantitative values you want to aggregate**
- 🪣 We define **columns as being an entity, dimension, or measure**. Columns will typically fit into one of these 3 buckets, or if they're a complex aggregation expression, they might constitute a metric.

## Defining orders

Let's zoom in on how we might define an _orders_ semantic model.

- 📗 We define it as a **YAML dictionary in the `semantic_models` list**.
- 📑 It will have a **name, entities list, dimensions list, and measures list**.
- ⏬ We recommend defining them **in this order consistently** as a style best practice.

<File name="models/marts/orders.yml" />

```yaml
semantic_models:
  - name: orders
    entities: ... # we'll define these later
    dimensions: ... # we'll define these later
    measures: ... # we'll define these later
```

- Next we'll point to the corresponding logical model by supplying a [`ref`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/ref) in the `model:` property, and a `description` for documentation.

<File name="models/marts/orders.yml" />

```yml
semantic_models:
  - name: orders
    description: |
      Model containing order data. The grain of the table is the order id.
    model: ref('stg_orders')
    entities: ...
    dimensions: ...
    measures: ...
```

## Establishing our entities

- 🫂 Entities are the **objects and concepts** in our data that _have_ dimensions and measures. You can think of them as the **nouns** of our project, the **spines** of our queries that we may want to aggregate by, or simply the **join keys**.
- 🔀 Entities help MetricFlow understand **how various semantic models relate to one another**.
- ⛓️ Unlike many other semantic layers, in MetricFlow **we do not need to describe joins explicitly**, instead the **relationships are implicitly described by entities**.
- 1️⃣ Each semantic model should have **one primary entity** defined for itself, and **any number of foreign entities** for other semantic models it may join to.
- 🫂 Entities require a **name and type**
  - 🔑 Types available are **primary**, **foreign**, **unique** or **natural** — we'll be focused on the first two for now, but you can [read more about unique and natural keys](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/entities#entity-types).

### Entities in action

If we look at an example staging model for orders, we see that it has 3 id columns, so we'll need three entities.

<File name="models/staging/stg_orders.sql" />

```sql
renamed as (

    select

        ----------  ids
        id as order_id,
        store_id as location_id,
        customer as customer_id,

        ---------- properties
        (order_total / 100.0) as order_total,
        (tax_paid / 100.0) as tax_paid,

        ---------- timestamps
        ordered_at

    from source
```

- 👉 We add them with a **`name`, `type`, and optional `expr`** (expression). The expression can be any valid SQL expression on your platform.
- 📛 If you **don't add an expression**, MetricFlow will **assume the name is equal to the column name** in the underlying logical model.
- 👍 Our best practices pattern is to, whenever possible, provide a `name` that is the singular form of the subject or grain of the table, and use `expr` to specify the precise column name (with `_id` etc). This will let us write **more readable metrics** on top of these semantic models. For example, we'll use `location` instead of `location_id`.

<File name="models/marts/orders.yml" />

```yml
semantic_models:
  - name: orders
    ...
    entities:
      # we use the column for the name here because order is a reserved word in SQL
      - name: order_id
        type: primary
      - name: location
        type: foreign
        expr: location_id
      - name: customer
        type: foreign
        expr: customer_id

    dimensions:
      ...
    measures:
      ...
```

## Defining our dimensions

- 🧮 Dimensions are the columns that we want to **filter and group by**, **the adjectives of our project**. They come in three types:
  - **categorical**
  - **time**
  - slowly changing dimensions — [these are covered in the documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/dimensions#scd-type-ii), and a little more complex. To focus on building your mental models of MetricFlow's fundamentals, we won't be using SCDs in this guide.
- ➕ We're **not limited to existing columns**, we can use the `expr` property to add simple computations in our dimensions.
- 📛 Categorical dimensions are the simplest, they simply require a `name` and `type` (type being categorical). **If the `name` property matches the name of the dimension column**, that's it, you're done. If you want or need to use a `name` other than the column name, or do some filtering or computation, **you can supply an optional `expr` property** to evaluate for the dimension.

### Dimensions in action

- 👀 Let's look at our staging model again and see what fields we have available.

<File name="models/staging/stg_orders.sql" />

```sql
select

    ----------  ids -> entities
    id as order_id,
    store_id as location_id,
    customer as customer_id,

    ---------- numerics -> measures
    (order_total / 100.0) as order_total,
    (tax_paid / 100.0) as tax_paid,

    ---------- timestamps -> dimensions
    ordered_at

from source
```

- ⏰ For now the only dimension to add is a **time dimension**: `ordered_at`.
- 🕰️ At least one **primary time dimension** is **required** for any semantic models that **have measures**.
- 1️⃣ We denote this with the `is_primary` property, or if there is only a one-time dimension supplied it is primary by default. Below we only have `ordered_at` as a timestamp so we don't need to specify anything except the _minimum granularity_ we're bucketing to (in this case, day). By this we mean that we're not going to be looking at orders at a finer granularity than a day.

<File name="models/marts/orders.yml" />

```yml
dimensions:
  - name: ordered_at
    expr: date_trunc('day', ordered_at)
    type: time
    type_params:
      time_granularity: day
```

:::tip
**Dimensional models**. You may have some models that do not contain measures, just dimensional data that enriches other facts. That's totally fine, a semantic model does not require dimensions or measures, it just needs a primary entity, and if you do have measures, a primary time dimension.

We'll discuss an alternate situation, dimensional tables that have static numeric values like supply costs or tax rates but no time dimensions, later in the Guide.
:::

- 🔢 We can also **make a dimension out of a numeric column** that would typically be a measure.
- 🪣 Using `expr` we can **create buckets of values that we label** for our dimension. We'll add one of these in for labeling 'large orders' as any order totals over $50.

<File name="models/marts/orders.yml" />

```yml
dimensions:
  - name: ordered_at
    expr: date_trunc('day', ordered_at)
    type: time
    type_params:
      time_granularity: day
  - name: is_large_order
    type: categorical
    expr: case when order_total > 50 then true else false end
```

## Making our measures

- 📏 Measures are the final component of a semantic model. They describe the **numeric values that we want to aggregate**.
- 🧱 Measures form **the building blocks of metrics**, with entities and dimensions helping us combine, group, and filter those metrics correctly.
- 🏃 You can think of them as something like the **verbs of a semantic model**.

### Measures in action

- 👀 Let's look at **our staging model** one last time and see what **fields we want to measure**.

<File name="models/staging/stg_orders.sql" />

```sql
select

    ----------  ids -> entities
    id as order_id,
    store_id as location_id,
    customer as customer_id,

    ---------- numerics -> measures
    (order_total / 100.0) as order_total,
    (tax_paid / 100.0) as tax_paid,

    ---------- timestamps -> dimensions
    ordered_at

from source
```

- ➕ Here `order_total` and `tax paid` are the **columns we want as measures**.
- 📝 We can describe them via the code below, specifying a **name, description, aggregation, and expression**.
- 👍 As before MetricFlow will default to the **name being the name of a column when no expression is supplied**.
- 🧮 [Many different aggregations](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/measures#aggregation) are available to us. Here we just want sums.

<File name="models/marts/orders.yml" />

```yml
measures:
  - name: order_total
    description: The total amount for each order including taxes.
    agg: sum
  - name: tax_paid
    description: The total tax paid on each order.
    agg: sum
```

- 🆕 We can also **create new measures using expressions**, for instance adding a count of individual orders as below.

<File name="models/marts/orders.yml" />

```yml
- name: order_count
  description: The count of individual orders.
  expr: 1
  agg: sum
```

## Reviewing our work

Our completed code will look like this, our first semantic model! Here are two examples showing different organizational approaches:

<Expandable alt_header="Parallel sub-folder approach">

<File name="models/semantic_models/sem_orders.yml" />

        agg: sum
      - name: tax_paid
        description: The total tax paid on each order.
        agg: sum
```
</Expandable>

As you can see, the content of the semantic model is identical in both approaches. The key differences are:

1. **File location**
   - Co-located approach: `models/marts/orders.yml`
   - Parallel sub-folder approach: `models/semantic_models/sem_orders.yml`

2. **File naming**
   - Co-located approach: Uses the same name as the corresponding mart (`orders.yml`)
   - Parallel sub-folder approach: Prefixes the file with `sem_` (`sem_orders.yml`)

Choose the approach that best fits your project structure and team preferences. The co-located approach is often simpler for new projects, while the parallel sub-folder approach can be clearer for migrating large existing projects to the Semantic Layer.

## Next steps

Let's review the basics of semantic models:

- 🧱 Consist of **entities, dimensions, and measures**.
- 🫂 Describe the **semantics and relationships of objects** in the warehouse.
- 1️⃣ Correspond to a **single logical model** in your dbt project.

Next up, let's use our new semantic model to **build a metric**!
