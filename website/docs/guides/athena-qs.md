## Introduction

In this quickstart guide, you'll learn how to use dbt Cloud with BigQuery. It will show you how to: 

- Create an S3 bucket for Athena query results.
- Creat an Athena database.
- Access sample data in a public dataset.
- Connect dbt Cloud to Amazon Athena.
- Take a sample query and turn it into a model in your dbt project. A model in dbt is a select statement.
- Add tests to your models.
- Document your models.
- Schedule a job to run.

### Set up the S3 bucket

You can use an existing or create a new S3 bucket for these steps.

1. Log into your AWS account and navigate to the **Athena console**.
    - If this is your first time in the Athena console (in your current AWS Region), click **Explore the query editor** to open the query editor. Otherwise, Athena opens automatically in the query editor.
1. Open **Settings** and find the **Location of query result box** field.
