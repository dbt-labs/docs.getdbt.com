## Set up dbt Cloud (Coalesce Workshop Only)

Let's get set up with a dbt Cloud sandbox that's already connected to a Snowflake account for the workshop.

1. Go to [bit.ly/coalesce-24-sandboxes](https://bit.ly/coalesce-24-sandboxes) to create an account. Make sure you log out of any other dbt Cloud accounts.
    
    a. Enter your **First Name** and **Last Name**
    
    b. For **Workshop**, choose **Test driving dbt Cloud CLI and dbt power user** from the dropdown
    
    c. The **Passcode** will be provided by your facilitators
    
    d. Accept the terms and click **Complete Registration**

1. Navigate to the platform project by selecting **Project** form the left sidebar and choosing **Platform Analytics**.

1. Select **Deploy >> Runs** to find the created jobs. For each job, click on the job and click **run**.

1. Now repeat for the **Analytics project**. Toggle into the Analytics project.

1. Select **Deploy >> Runs** to find the created jobs. For the one job, click on the job and click **run**.

1. Select **Explore** from the navigation and choose XX. Now you can visualize your dbt Mesh. Click into each project to see project level lineage.

You've now successfully run your project in deployment environments so you can use cross project ref and deferral later in the workshop. 

## Configure dbt Cloud CLI

Now we'll clone the project repository and configure dbt Cloud CLI to connect to your sandbox.

### Clone the repo

1. Navigate to a folder on your computer to clone the repository.

1. In your terminal, run the following command to clone the downstream (analytics) project:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/dbt-labs/c24-workshops-analytics.git
    ```

### Install Cloud CLI

1. In dbt Cloud, select Platform Analytics and choose **Develop >> Configure Cloud CLI**.

1. Based on your current local setup, use the following guidance to determine your installation approach:

    a. Check if you have dbt in your PATH by running `dbt --version`

    b. If you don't have dbt in your PATH, we recommend the macOS or Windows installation method.

    c. If you do have dbt in your PATH (global environment), we recommend:
        1. Uninstalling dbt globally
        2. Installing dbt Cloud CLI with a Python virtual environment

    d. If you have dbt in a virtual environment, install dbt Cloud CLI with a separate Python virtual environment. Be sure to activate it with `source <path to env>/bin/activate`.

1. Download the CLI configuration file from the dbt Cloud UI. Save it in your `.dbt` folder.

1. Navigate to the dbt project folder that you cloned earlier and open the `dbt_project.yml` file with your `project_id`.

### Confirm the installation

Run `dbt compile` to verify your installation.

There you go! You've installed the dbt Cloud CLI! Let's dive in!

### Additional resources
Consult the following docs if you run into problems when trying to install the dbt Cloud CLI:
- [Install dbt Cloud CLI](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation)
- [Configure and use dbt Cloud CLI](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/configure-cloud-cli)

## Leverage dbt Cloud CLI

Let's run a few commands together to get comfortable with the dbt Cloud CLI:
* `dbt debug` &mdash; Displays your connection details and information
* `dbt compile --select stg_campaigns` &mdash; Compiles your dbt project
* `dbt run --select stg_campaigns` &mdash; Materialized your dbt models
* `dbt run --select stg_campaigns` &mdash; Preview the results of a model
* `dbt test --select stg_campaigns` &mdash; Execute tests against your materialized models

Now let's dive into some more advanced components of dbt Cloud CLI.

### Deferral

Deferral is a powerful functionality, allowing you to leverage upstream assets that exist outside of your personal development environment. As a result, you can speed up your development workflows and save on warehouse compute costs. Let's run a few commands using deferral:

1. Run `dbt compile -s stg_campaigns`. Notice how we're able to resolve dependencies in the compiled SQL without seeding `campaigns.csv`.
1. Now let's modify the `stg_campaigns` model by adding a timestamp:
    ```sql
    current_timestamp() as updated_at
    ```

    Let's build that model with the next command.
1. Run `dbt build --select stg_campaigns`. We're utilizing deferral and the concept of "statefulness" to check with objects that have been modified and resolve dependencies of upstream assets if they exist.

    By default, the dbt Cloud CLI defers to a [Staging](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/deploy-environments#staging-environment) environment if one exists. If not, dbt uses the assets from the Production environment.

    To override which environment the dbt Cloud CLI defers to, you can set a `defer-env-id` key in either your `dbt_project.yml` or `dbt_cloud.yml` file. For example:

    ```yml
    dbt-cloud:
        defer-env-id: '123456'
    ```

### dbt Mesh

You have access to cross-project ref's that's powered by the metadata of dbt Cloud.

1. Open the `agg_campaign_customer_contacts` model.
1. Find the reference called `{{ ref('platform', 'dim_customers', v=1) }}`.
1. Run the command:

    ```shell
    dbt run --select agg_campaign_customer_contacts
    ```

1. Navigate to dbt Cloud Explorer and find a public model. Let's use the `fct_order_items` model.
1. Create a new model called `agg_orders` in your project with the following code:

    ```sql
    with orders as (
    
        select * from {{ ref('platform', 'fct_order_items') }}

    ),

    final as (
    
        select
            customer_key as customer_id,
            is_return as return_status,
            count(*) as count_orders

        from
            orders
        group by
            customer_key,
            is_return
    )

    select * from final
    ```

### Linting and fixing SQL files

With SQLFluff built in, you can check your code against a style guide and automatically make fixes.

1. Run the SQLFluff command `lint`:

    ```shell
    dbt sqlfluff lint models/staging/campaigns/stg_campaigns.sql --dialect snowflake
    ```

    This identifies tweaks to make in the `stg_campaigns` model.
2. Run the SQLFluff command `fix`:

    ```shell
    dbt sqlfluff fix models/staging/campaigns/stg_campaigns.sql --dialect snowflake
    ```

    This attempts to directly make fixes in the `stg_campaigns` model.

### Change branches

You can quickly change branches without fully pushing to your Git provider (such as GitHub):

```shell
git checkout -b my-new-branch

git checkout main
```

Now you've taken a tour of what you can do with dbt Cloud CLI. Let's dive into dbt Power User next.

## Install dbt Power User

Let's get dbt Power User installed to supercharge our workflow.

1. From Visual Studio Code, click on extensions and search for "Power User for dbt".
