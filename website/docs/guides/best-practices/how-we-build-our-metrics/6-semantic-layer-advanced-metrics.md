## More advanced metric types

We're not limited to just passing measures through to our metrics, we can also _combine_ measures to model more advanced metrics.

- Ratio metrics are, as the name implies, about comparing to measures as a numerator and a denominator to form a metric, for instance the percentage of order items that are food items instead of drinks.
- Derived metrics are when we want to write an expression that calculates a metric using more than one measure. A classic example here is our gross profit calculated by subtracting costs from revenue.
- Cumulative metrics calculate all of a measure over a given window, such as the past week, or if no window is supplied, the all-time total of that measure.

## Ratio metrics

- We need to establish one measure that will be our **numerator**, and one that will be our **denominator**.
- Let's calculate the percentage of our Jaffle Shop revenue that comes from food items.
- We already have our denominator, revenue, but we'll want to make a new metric for our numerator called `food_revenue`.

```YAML
 - name: food_revenue
    description: The revenue from food in each order.
    label: Food Revenue
    type: simple
    type_params:
      measure: revenue
      filter: |
        {{dimension('is_food_order')}} = true
```

- Now we can set up our ratio metric.

```YAML
- name: food_revenue_pct
  description: The % of order revenue from food.
  label: Food Revenue %
  type: ratio
  type_params:
    numerator: food_revenue
    denominator: revenue
```

## Derived metrics

- Now let's really have some fun. One of the most important metrics for any business is not just revenue, but _revenue growth_. Let's use a derived metric to build month-over-month revenue.
- A derived metric has a couple key components:
  - A list of metrics to build on. These can be manipulated and filtered in various way, here we'll use the `offset_window` property to lag by a month.
  - An expression that performs a calculation with these metrics.
- With these parts we can assemble complex logic that would otherwise need to be 'frozen' in logical models.

```YAML
- name: revenue_growth_mom
  description: "Percentage growth of revenue compared to 1 month ago. Excluded tax"
  type: derived
  label: Revenue Growth % M/M
  type_params:
    expr: (current_revenue - revenue_prev_month) * 100 / revenue_prev_month
    metrics:
      - name: revenue
        alias: current_revenue
      - name: revenue
        offset_window: 1 month
        alias: revenue_prev_month
```

## Cumulative metrics

- Lastly, lets build a cumulative metric. In keeping with our theme of business priorities, let's continue with revenue and build an all-time revenue metric for any given time winddow.
- All we need to do is indicate the type is `cumulative` and not supply a `window` in the `type_params`, which indicates we want cumulative for the entire time period our end users select.

```YAML
- name: cumulative_revenue
  description: The cumulative revenue for all orders.
  label: Cumulative Revenue (All Time)
  type: cumulative
  type_params:
    measure: revenue
```
