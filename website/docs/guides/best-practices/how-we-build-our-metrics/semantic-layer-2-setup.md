## Getting started

First, if you want to follow along, we'll need to clone the [example project](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle-sl-template). You will need access to a Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, or Postgres warehouse for this, for the time being. The project is our classic Jaffle Shop, a simulated chain restaurant serving [jaffles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_iron) and tasty beverages.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:dbt-labs/jaffle-sl-template.git
cd path/to/project
```

Next before we start writing code, we'll need to install the MetricFlow CLI as an extension of a dbt adapter from PyPI. The MetricFlow CLI is compatible with Python versions 3.8 through 3.11.

We'll use pip to install MetricFlow and our dbt adapter:

```shell
# activate a virtual environment for your project,
# if you don't have a name you like to use we suggest .venv
python -m venv [virtual environment name]
source [virtual environment name]/bin/activate
# install dbt and MetricFlow
pip install dbt-metricflow[adapter name]
# e.g. dbt-metricflow[snowflake]
```

Lastly, to get to the pre-Semantic Layer starting state, checkout the `start-here` branch.

```shell
git checkout start-here
```

For more information you can [look at the docs](/docs/build/metricflow-cli) or checkout a [Quickstart](https://docs.getdbt.com/quickstarts) to get more familiar with setting up a dbt project.

## Basic commands

- üíª This package will install both `dbt` and `mf` as CLIs in our virtual environment. All the regular `dbt` commands like `run`, `build`, and `test` are available.
- üîç A less common one that will come in handy with the Semantic Layer is `dbt parse`. This will parse your project and generate a **semantic manifest**, a representation of meaningful connections described by your project. This file gives MetricFlow a **state of the world from which to generate queries**.
- üß∞ In addition to `dbt`, you'll have access to `mf` commands like `query` and `validate-configs`, which operate based on that semantic manifest. We'll dig more into all of these as we go along.
- üõ†Ô∏è Lets start off by running a `dbt build` to get the **starting state** of our project built.
