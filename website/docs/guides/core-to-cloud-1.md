dbt Cloud is the fastest and most reliable way to deploy dbt. It enables you to develop, test, deploy, and explore data products using a single, fully managed service. It also supports:
- Development experiences tailored to multiple personas ([dbt Cloud IDE](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud) or [dbt Cloud CLI](/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation))
- Out-of-the-box [CI/CD workflows](/docs/deploy/ci-jobs)
- The [dbt Semantic Layer](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/dbt-sl) for consistent metrics
- Domain ownership of data with multi-project [dbt Mesh](/best-practices/how-we-mesh/mesh-1-intro) setups
- [dbt Explorer](/docs/collaborate/explore-projects) for easier data discovery and understanding

Learn more about [dbt Cloud features](/docs/cloud/about-cloud/dbt-cloud-features).

dbt Core is an open-source tool that enables data teams to define and execute data transformations in a cloud data warehouse following analytics engineering best practices. While this can work well for ‘single players’ and small technical teams, all development happens on a command-line interface, and production deployments must be self-hosted and maintained. This requires significant, costly work that adds up over time to maintain and scale.

## Prerequisites

- You have an existing dbt Core project connected to a Git repository and data platform supported in [dbt Cloud](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/about-connections).
- A [supported version](/docs/dbt-versions/core) of dbt or select [**Versionless**](/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-dbt-version-in-cloud#versionless) of dbt. <Lifecycle status="Preview"/>
- You have a dbt Cloud account. **[Don't have one? Start your free trial today](https://www.getdbt.com/signup)**!

## Account setup

This section outlines the steps to set up your dbt Cloud account and configure it for your team.

1. [Create your dbt Cloud account](https://www.getdbt.com/signup).

2. Provide user [access](/docs/cloud/manage-access/about-user-access) and [invite users](/docs/cloud/manage-access/about-user-access) to your dbt Cloud account and project.

3. Configure [Single Sign-On (SSO)](/docs/cloud/manage-access/sso-overview) or [Role-based access control (RBAC)](/docs/cloud/manage-access/about-user-access#role-based-access-control) for easy and secure access. <Lifecycle status='enterprise' />
   - This removes the need to save passwords and secret environment variables locally.

### Additional configuration
Explore these additional configurations for performance and reliability improvements:

1. In **Account settings**, enable [partial parsing](/docs/deploy/deploy-environments#partial-parsing) to only reparse changed files, saving time.

2. In **Account settings**, enable [Git repo caching](/docs/deploy/deploy-environments#git-repository-caching) for job reliability & third-party outage protection. <Lifecycle status='enterprise' />

## Data platform setup

This section outlines the considerations and methods to connect your data platform to dbt Cloud.

1. In dbt Cloud, set up your [data platform connections](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/about-connections) and [environment variables](/docs/build/environment-variables). dbt Cloud can connect with a variety of data platform providers including:
   - [AlloyDB](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/connect-redshift-postgresql-alloydb) 
   - [Amazon Redshift](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/connect-redshift-postgresql-alloydb) 
   - [Apache Spark](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/connect-apache-spark) 
   - [Databricks](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/connect-databricks) 
   - [Google BigQuery](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/connect-bigquery)
   - [Microsoft Fabric](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/connect-microsoft-fabric)
   - [PostgreSQL](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/connect-redshift-postgresql-alloydb)
   - [Snowflake](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/connect-snowflake)
   - [Starburst or Trino](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/connect-starburst-trino)

2. You can verify your data platform connections by clicking the **Test connection** button in your deployment and development credentials settings.

### Additional configuration

Explore these additional configurations to optimize your data platform setup further:

1. Use [OAuth connections](/docs/cloud/manage-access/set-up-snowflake-oauth), which enables secure authentication using your data platform’s SSO.  <Lifecycle status='enterprise' />

## Git setup

Your existing dbt project source code should live in a Git repository. In this section, you will connect your existing dbt project source code from Git to dbt Cloud.

1. Ensure your dbt project is in a Git repository.

2. In **Account settings**, select **Integrations** to [connect your Git repository](/docs/cloud/git/git-configuration-in-dbt-cloud) to dbt Cloud:
   - (**Recommended**) Connect with one of the [native integrations](/docs/cloud/git/git-configuration-in-dbt-cloud) in dbt Cloud (such as GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps).

     This method is preferred for its simplicity, security features (including secure OAuth logins and automated workflows like CI builds on pull requests), and overall ease of use.
   - [Import a Git repository](/docs/cloud/git/import-a-project-by-git-url) from any valid Git URL that points to a dbt project.

### Additional configuration
Explore these additional configurations to optimize your Git setup further:

1. Log into dbt Cloud using [OAuth connections](/docs/cloud/git/connect-github) to integrate with your source code platform. It automatically links to the repository using one of the native integrations set at the account level. <Lifecycle status='enterprise' />
  
  Set up groups for dbt project access with those configured for repository access to streamline permissions.

## Developer setup

This section highlights the development configurations you’ll need for your dbt Cloud project. The following categories are covered in this section:

- [dbt Cloud environments](/guides/core-to-cloud-1?step=7#dbt-cloud-environments)
- [Initial setup steps](/guides/core-to-cloud-1?step=7#initial-setup-steps)
- [Additional configuration](/guides/core-to-cloud-1?step=7#additional-configuration-2)
- [dbt Cloud commands](/guides/core-to-cloud-1?step=7#dbt-cloud-commands)

### dbt Cloud environments

The most common data environments are production, staging, and development. The way dbt Core manages [environments](/docs/environments-in-dbt) is through `target`, which are different sets of connection details. 

[dbt Cloud environments](/docs/dbt-cloud-environments) go further by:
- Integrating with features such as job scheduling or version control, making it easier to manage the full lifecycle of your dbt projects within a single platform.
- Streamlining the process of switching between development, staging, and production contexts.
- Making it easy to configure environments through the dbt Cloud UI instead of manually editing the `profiles.yml` file. You can also [set up](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/target) or [customize](/docs/build/custom-target-names) target names in dbt Cloud.
- Adding `profiles.yml` attributes to dbt Cloud environment settings with [Extended Attributes](/docs/dbt-cloud-environments#extended-attributes).
- Using [Git repo caching](/docs/dbt-cloud-environments#git-repository-caching) to protect you from third-party outages, Git auth failures, and more. <Lifecycle status="enterprise"/>

### Initial setup steps
1. **Set up development environment** &mdash; Set up your [development](/docs/dbt-cloud-environments#create-a-development-environment) environment and [development credentials](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud#access-the-cloud-ide). You’ll need this to access your dbt project and start developing.

2. **dbt Core version** &mdash; In your dbt Cloud environment and credentials, use the same dbt Core version you use locally. You can run `dbt --version` in the command line to find out which version of dbt Core you’re using.
   - When using dbt Core, you need to think about which version you’re using and manage your own upgrades. When using dbt Cloud, leverage ["Versionless"](/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-dbt-version-in-cloud#versionless) so you don’t have to.

3. **Connect to your data platform** &mdash; When using dbt Cloud, you can [connect to your data platform](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/about-connections) directly in the UI.
   - Each environment is roughly equivalent to an entry in your `profiles.yml` file. This means you don't need a `profiles.yml` file in your project.

4. **Development tools** &mdash; Set up your development workspace with the [dbt Cloud CLI](/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation) (command line interface or code editor) or [dbt Cloud IDE](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud) (browser-based) to build, test, run, and version control your dbt code in your tool of choice.
   - If you've previously installed dbt Core, the [dbt Cloud CLI installation doc](/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation?install=pip#install-dbt-cloud-cli) has more information on how to install the dbt Cloud CLI, create aliases, or uninstall dbt Core for a smooth transition.

### Additional configuration
Explore these additional configurations to optimize your developer setup further:

1. **Custom target names** &mdash; Using [`custom target.names`](/docs/build/custom-target-names) in your dbt projects helps identify different environments (like development, staging, and production). While you can specify the `custom target.name` values in your developer credentials or orchestration setup, we recommend using [environment variables](/docs/build/environment-variables) as the preferred method. They offer a clearer way to handle different environments and are better supported by dbt's partial parsing feature, unlike using [`{{ target }}` logic](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/target) which is meant for defining the data warehouse connection.

### dbt Cloud commands
1. Review the [dbt commands](/reference/dbt-commands) supported for dbt Cloud development. For example, `dbt init` isn’t needed in dbt Cloud as you can create a new project directly in dbt Cloud.

## Environment variables
This section will help you understand how to set up and manage dbt Cloud environment variables for your project. The following categories are covered:
- [Environment variables in dbt Cloud](/guides/core-to-cloud-1?step=7#environment-variables-in-dbt-cloud)
- [dbt Cloud environment variables order of precedence](/guides/core-to-cloud-1?step=7#dbt-cloud-environment-variables-order-of-precedence)
- [Set environment variables in dbt Cloud](/guides/core-to-cloud-1?step=7#set-environment-variables-in-dbt-cloud)

In dbt Cloud, you can set [environment variables](/docs/build/environment-variables) in the dbt Cloud user interface (UI). Read [Set up environment variables](#set-environment-variables-in-dbt-cloud) for more info.

In dbt Core, environment variables, or the [`env_var` function](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/env_var), are defined manually by the developer or within the external application running dbt.

### Environment variables in dbt Cloud
  - dbt Cloud environment variables must be prefixed with `DBT_` (including `DBT_ENV_CUSTOM_ENV_` or `DBT_ENV_SECRET`).
  - If your dbt Core environment variables don’t follow this naming convention, perform a [“find and replace”](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud#dbt-cloud-ide-features) in your project to make sure all references to these environment variables contain the proper naming conventions.
- dbt Cloud secures environment variables that enable more flexible configuration of data warehouse connections or git provider integrations, offering additional measures for sensitive values, such as prefixing keys with `DBT_ENV_SECRET`to obscure them in logs and the UI.

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/Environment Variables/project-environment-view.png" title="Setting project level and environment level values"/>

### dbt Cloud environment variables order of precedence
Environment variables in dbt Cloud are managed with a clear [order of precedence](/docs/build/environment-variables#setting-and-overriding-environment-variables), allowing users to define values at four levels (highest to lowest order of precedence):
   - The job level (job override) or in the IDE for an individual developer (personal override). _Highest precedence_
   - The environment level, which can be overridden by the job level or personal override.
   - A project-wide default value, which can be overridden by the environment level, job level, or personal override.
   - The optional default argument supplied to the `env_var` Jinja function in the code. _Lowest precedence_
  
<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/Environment Variables/env-var-precdence.png" title="Environment variables order of precedence"/>

### Set environment variables in dbt Cloud

- To set these variables for an entire project or specific environments, navigate to **Deploy** > **Environments** > **Environment variables** tab.
- To set these variables at the job level, navigate to **Deploy** > **Jobs** > **Select your job** > **Settings** > **Advanced settings**.
- To set these variables at the personal override level, navigate to **Profile Settings** > **Credentials** > **Select your project** > **Environment variables**.

## Orchestration setup

This section outlines the considerations and methods to set up your dbt Cloud environments and jobs for orchestration. The following categories are covered in this section:

- [dbt Cloud environments](/guides/core-to-cloud-1?step=8#dbt-cloud-environments-1)
- [Initial setup steps](/guides/core-to-cloud-1?step=8#initial-setup-steps-1)
- [Additional configuration](/guides/core-to-cloud-1?step=8#additional-configuration-3)
- [CI/CD setup](/guides/core-to-cloud-1?step=8#cicd-setup)

### dbt Cloud environments
To use the [dbt Cloud's job scheduler](/docs/deploy/job-scheduler), set up one environment as the production environment. This is the [deployment](/docs/deploy/deploy-environments) environment. You can set up multiple environments for different stages of your deployment pipeline, such as development, staging/QA, and production.

### Initial setup steps
1. **dbt Core version** &mdash; In your environment settings, configure dbt Cloud with the same dbt Core version.
   - Once your full migration is complete, we recommend upgrading your environments to ["Versionless"](/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-dbt-version-in-cloud#versionless) to always get the latest features and more. You only need to do this once.

2. **Configure your jobs** &mdash; [Create jobs](/docs/deploy/deploy-jobs#create-and-schedule-jobs) for scheduled or event-driven dbt jobs. You can use cron execution, manual, pull requests, or trigger on the completion of another job.
   - Note that alongside [jobs in dbt Cloud](/docs/deploy/jobs), discover other ways to schedule and run your dbt jobs with the help of other tools. Refer to [Integrate with other tools](/docs/deploy/deployment-tools) for more information.

### Additional configuration
Explore these additional configurations to optimize your dbt Cloud orchestration setup further:

1. **Custom target names** &mdash; Use environment variables to set a `custom target.name` for every [corresponding dbt Cloud job](/docs/build/custom-target-names) at the environment level.

2. **dbt commands** &mdash; Add any relevant [dbt commands](/docs/deploy/job-commands) to execute your dbt Cloud jobs runs.

3. **Notifications** &mdash; Set up [notifications](/docs/deploy/job-notifications) by configuring email and Slack alerts to monitor your jobs.

4. **Monitoring tools** &mdash; Use [monitoring tools](/docs/deploy/monitor-jobs) like run history, job retries, job chaining, dashboard status tiles, and more for a seamless orchestration experience.

5. **API access** &mdash; Create [API auth tokens](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/authentication) and access to [dbt Cloud APIs](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/overview) as needed.  <Lifecycle status="team,enterprise" />

6. **dbt Explorer** &mdash; If you use [dbt Explorer](/docs/collaborate/explore-projects) and run production jobs with an external orchestrator, ensure your production jobs run `dbt run` or `dbt build` to update and view models and their [metadata](/docs/collaborate/explore-projects#generate-metadata) in dbt Explorer. Running `dbt compile`  alone will not update model metadata. In addition, features like column-level lineage also requires catalog metadata produced through running `dbt docs generate`. <Lifecycle status="team,enterprise" />

### CI/CD setup

Building a custom solution to efficiently check code upon pull requests is complicated. With dbt Cloud, you can enable [continuous integration / continuous deployment (CI/CD)](/docs/deploy/continuous-integration) and configure dbt Cloud to run your dbt projects in a temporary schema when new commits are pushed to open pull requests.

This build-on-PR functionality is a great way to catch bugs before deploying to production, and an essential tool for data practitioners.

1. Set up an integration with a native Git application (such as Azure DevOps, GitHub, GitLab) and a CI environment in dbt Cloud.
2. Create [a CI/CD job](/docs/deploy/ci-jobs) to automate quality checks before code is deployed to production.
3. Run your jobs in a production environment to fully implement CI/CD. Future pull requests will also leverage the last production runs to compare against.

## Model development and discovery

In this section, you’ll be able to validate whether your models run or compile correctly in your development tool of choice: The [dbt Cloud IDE](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud) or [dbt Cloud CLI](/docs/cloud/cloud-cli-installation).

You’ll want to make sure you set up your [development environment and credentials](/docs/dbt-cloud-environments#set-developer-credentials).

1. In your [development tool](/docs/cloud/about-develop-dbt) of choice, you can review your dbt project, ensure it's set up correctly, and run some [dbt commands](/reference/dbt-commands):
   - Run `dbt compile` to make sure your project compiles correctly.
   - Run a few models in the dbt Cloud IDE or dbt Cloud CLI to ensure you’re experiencing accurate results in development.

2. Once your first job has successfully run in your production environment, use [dbt Explorer](/docs/collaborate/explore-projects) to view your project's [resources](/docs/build/projects) (such as models, tests, and metrics) and their <Term id="data-lineage" />  to gain a better understanding of its latest production state. <Lifecycle status="team,enterprise" />
