When it comes to documentation, dbt brings together both column and model level descriptions that you can provide as well as details from your Snowflake information schema in a static site for consumption by other data team members and stakeholders.

We are going to revisit 2 areas of our project to understand our documentation:

- `intermediate.md` file
- `dbt_project.yml` file

To start, letâ€™s look back at our `intermediate.md` file. We can see that we provided multi-line descriptions for the models in our intermediate models using [docs blocks](/docs/collaborate/documentation#using-docs-blocks). Then we reference these docs blocks in our `.yml` file. Building descriptions with doc blocks in Markdown files gives you the ability to format your descriptions with Markdown and are particularly helpful when building long descriptions, either at the column or model level. In our `dbt_project.yml`, we added `node_colors` at folder levels.

1. To see all these pieces come together, execute this in the command bar:
  ```bash
  dbt docs generate
  ``` 
  This will generate the documentation for your project. Click the book button, as shown in the screenshot below to access the docs.

2. Go to our project area and view `int_results`. View the description that we created in our doc block.

3. View the mini-lineage that looks at the model we are currently selected on (`int_results` in this case).

4. In our `dbt_project.yml`, we configured `node_colors` depending on the file directory. Starting in dbt v1.3, we can see how our lineage in our docs looks. By color coding your project, it can help you cluster together similar models or steps and more easily troubleshoot.
