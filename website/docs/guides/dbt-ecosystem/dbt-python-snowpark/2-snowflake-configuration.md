1. Log in to your trial Snowflake account. You can [sign up for a Snowflake Trial Account using this form](https://signup.snowflake.com/) if you donâ€™t have one.
2. Ensure that your account is set up using **AWS** in the **US East (N. Virginia)**. We will be copying the data from a public AWS S3 bucket hosted by dbt Labs in the us-east-1 region. By ensuring our Snowflake environment setup matches our bucket region, we avoid any multi-region data copy and retrieval latency issues.

3. After creating your account and verifying it from your sign-up email, Snowflake will direct you back to the UI called Snowsight.

4. When Snowsight first opens, your window should look like the following, with you logged in as the ACCOUNTADMIN with demo worksheets open:
