1. We are going to be using [Snowflake Partner Connect](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ecosystem-partner-connect.html) to set up a dbt Cloud account. Using this method will allow you to spin up a fully fledged dbt account with your [Snowflake connection](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/connect-snowflake), [managed repository](/docs/collaborate/git/managed-repository), environments, and credentials already established.
2. Navigate out of your worksheet back by selecting **home**.
3. In Snowsight, confirm that you are using the **ACCOUNTADMIN** role.
4. Navigate to the **Admin** **> Partner Connect**. Find **dbt** either by using the search bar or navigating the **Data Integration**. Select the **dbt** tile.

5. You should now see a new window that says **Connect to dbt**. Select **Optional Grant** and add the `FORMULA1` database. This will grant access for your new dbt user role to the FORMULA1 database.

6. Ensure the `FORMULA1` is present in your optional grant before clicking **Connect**.  This will create a dedicated dbt user, database, warehouse, and role for your dbt Cloud trial.

7. When you see the **Your partner account has been created** window, click **Activate**.

8. You should be redirected to a dbt Cloud registration page. Fill out the form. Make sure to save the password somewhere for login in the future.

9. Select **Complete Registration**. You should now be redirected to your dbt Cloud account, complete with a connection to your Snowflake account, a deployment and a development environment, and a sample job.

10. To help you version control your dbt project, we have connected it to a [managed repository](/docs/collaborate/git/managed-repository), which means that dbt Labs will be hosting your repository for you. This will give you access to a Git workflow without you having to create and host the repository yourself. You will not need to know Git for this workshop; dbt Cloud will help guide you through the workflow. In the future, when you’re developing your own project, [feel free to use your own repository](/docs/cloud/git/connect-github). This will allow you to learn more about features like [Slim CI](/docs/deploy/cloud-ci-job#configuring-a-slim-ci-job) builds after this workshop.
