## Introduction

Adapters are an essential component of dbt. At their most basic level, they are how dbt connects with the various supported data platforms. At a higher-level, dbt Core adapters strive to give analytics engineers more transferrable skills as well as standardize how analytics projects are structured. Gone are the days where you have to learn a new language or flavor of SQL when you move to a new job that has a different data platform. That is the power of adapters in dbt Core.
 
 Navigating and developing around the nuances of different databases can be daunting, but you are not alone. Visit [#adapter-ecosystem](https://getdbt.slack.com/archives/C030A0UF5LM) Slack channel for additional help beyond the documentation.

### All databases are not the same

There's a tremendous amount of work that goes into creating a database. Here is a high-level list of typical database layers (from the outermost layer moving inwards):
- SQL API
- Client Library / Driver
- Server Connection Manager
- Query parser
- Query optimizer
- Runtime
- Storage Access Layer
- Storage

There's a lot more there than just SQL as a language. Databases (and data warehouses) are so popular because you can abstract away a great deal of the complexity from your brain to the database itself. This enables you to focus more on the data.

dbt allows for further abstraction and standardization of the outermost layers of a database (SQL API, client library, connection manager) into a framework that both:
 - Opens database technology to less technical users (a large swath of a DBA's role has been automated, similar to how the vast majority of folks with websites today no longer have to be "[webmasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmaster)").
 - Enables more meaningful conversations about how data warehousing should be done.

This is where dbt adapters become critical.

### What needs to be adapted?

dbt adapters are responsible for _adapting_ dbt's standard functionality to a particular database. Our prototypical database and adapter are PostgreSQL and dbt-postgres, and most of our adapters are somewhat based on the functionality described in dbt-postgres.

Connecting dbt to a new database will require a new adapter to be built or an existing adapter to be extended.

The outermost layers of a database map roughly to the areas in which the dbt adapter framework encapsulates inter-database differences.

### SQL API

Even amongst ANSI-compliant databases, there are differences in the SQL grammar. 
Here are some categories and examples of SQL statements that can be constructed differently:

| Category                                     | Area of differences                                                                     | Examples                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Statement syntax                             | The use of `IF EXISTS`                                                                 | <li>`IF <TABLE> EXISTS, DROP TABLE`</li><li>`DROP <TABLE> IF EXISTS`</li>                                                                                                                                  |
| Workflow definition & semantics              | Incremental updates                                                                              | <li>`MERGE`</li><li>`DELETE; INSERT`</li>                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Relation and column attributes/configuration | Database-specific materialization configs | <li>`DIST = ROUND_ROBIN` (Synapse)</li><li>`DIST = EVEN` (Redshift)</li> |
| Permissioning                                | Grant statements that can only take one grantee at a time vs those that accept lists of grantees | <li>`grant SELECT on table dinner.corn to corn_kid, everyone` </li><li>`grant SELECT on table dinner.corn to corn_kid; grant SELECT on table dinner.corn to everyone`</li> |

### Python Client Library & Connection Manager

The other big category of inter-database differences comes with how the client connects to the database and executes queries against the connection. To integrate with dbt, a data platform must have a pre-existing python client library or support ODBC, using a generic python library like pyodbc.

| Category                     | Area of differences              | Examples                                                                                                    |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Credentials & authentication | Authentication                             | <li>Username & password</li><li>MFA with `boto3` or Okta token</li>                                                |
| Connection opening/closing   | Create a new connection to db             |<li>`psycopg2.connect(connection_string)`</li><li>`google.cloud.bigquery.Client(...)`</li>                        |
| Inserting local data         | Load seed .`csv` files into Python memory |<li> `google.cloud.bigquery.Client.load_table_from_file(...)` (BigQuery)</li><li>`INSERT ... INTO VALUES ...` prepared statement (most other databases)</li> |


### How dbt encapsulates and abstracts these differences

Differences between databases are encoded into discrete areas:

| Components       | Code Path                                         | Function                                                                      |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Python classes   | `adapters/<adapter_name>`                         | Configuration (Refer to [Python classes](#python classes)                   |
| Macros           | `include/<adapter_name>/macros/adapters/`         | SQL API & statement syntax (for example, how to create schema or how to get table info) |
| Materializations | `include/<adapter_name>/macros/materializations/` | Table/view/snapshot/ workflow definitions                                     |


#### Python classes

These classes implement all the methods responsible for:
- Connecting to a database and issuing queries.
- Providing dbt with database-specific configuration information.

| Class                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AdapterClass | High-level configuration type conversion and any database-specific python methods needed |
| AdapterCredentials       | Typed dictionary of possible profiles and associated methods                                                                                                                                |
| AdapterConnectionManager | All the methods responsible for connecting to a database and issuing queries                                                                                                                |
| AdapterRelation          | How relation names should be rendered, printed, and quoted. Do relation names use all three parts? `catalog.model_name` (two-part name) or `database.schema.model_name` (three-part name) |
| AdapterColumn            | How names should be rendered, and database-specific properties                                                                                                                              |

#### Macros

A set of *macros* responsible for generating SQL that is compliant with the target database.

#### Materializations

A set of *materializations* and their corresponding helper macros defined in dbt using jinja and SQL. They codify for dbt how model files should be persisted into the database.

### Adapter Architecture


Below is a flow diagram illustrating how a `dbt run` command works with the `dbt-postgres` adapter. It shows the relationship between `dbt-core`, `dbt-adapters`, and individual adapters.

<Lightbox src="/img/adapter-guide/adapter-architecture-diagram.png" title="Diagram of adapter architecture"/>

## Prerequisites

It is very important that you have the right skills, and understand the level of difficulty required to make an adapter for your data platform.

The more you can answer Yes to the below questions, the easier your adapter development (and user-) experience will be. See the [New Adapter Information Sheet wiki](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/wiki/New-Adapter-Information-Sheet) for even more specific questions.

### Training

- The developer (and any product managers) ideally will have substantial experience as an end-user of dbt. If not, it is highly advised that you at least take the [dbt Fundamentals](https://learn.getdbt.com/courses/dbt-fundamentals) and [Advanced Materializations](https://learn.getdbt.com/courses/advanced-materializations) course.

### Database

- Does the database complete transactions fast enough for interactive development?
- Can you execute SQL against the data platform?
- Is there a concept of schemas?
- Does the data platform support ANSI SQL, or at least a subset?

### Driver / Connection Library

- Is there a Python-based driver for interacting with the database that is db API 2.0 compliant (e.g. Psycopg2 for Postgres, pyodbc for SQL Server)
- Does it support: prepared statements, multiple statements, or single sign on token authorization to the data platform?

### Open source software

- Does your organization have an established process for publishing open source software?

It is easiest to build an adapter for dbt when the following the <Term id="data-warehouse" />/platform in question has:

- a conventional ANSI-SQL interface (or as close to it as possible),
- a mature connection library/SDK that uses ODBC or Python DB 2 API, and
- a way to enable developers to iterate rapidly with both quick reads and writes

### Maintaining your new adapter

When your adapter becomes more popular, and people start using it, you may quickly become the maintainer of an increasingly popular open source project. With this new role, comes some unexpected responsibilities that not only include code maintenance, but also working with a community of users and contributors. To help people understand what to expect of your project, you should communicate your intentions early and often in your adapter documentation or README. Answer questions like, Is this experimental work that people should use at their own risk? Or is this production-grade code that you're committed to maintaining into the future?

#### Keeping the code compatible with dbt Core

An adapter is compatible with dbt Core if it has correctly implemented the interface defined in [dbt-adapters](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/) and is tested by [dbt-tests-adapters](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/tree/main/dbt-tests-adapter). Prior to dbt Core version 1.8, this interface was contained in `dbt-core`. 

New minor version releases of `dbt-adapters` may include changes to the Python interface for adapter plugins, as well as new or updated test cases. The maintainers of `dbt-adapters` will clearly communicate these changes in documentation and release notes, and they will aim for backwards compatibility whenever possible.

Patch releases of `dbt-adapters` will _not_ include breaking changes or new features to adapter-facing code.

#### Versioning and releasing your adapter

dbt Labs strongly recommends you to adopt the following approach when versioning and releasing your plugin. 

- Declare major version compatibility with `dbt-adapters` and only set a boundary on the minor version if there is some known reason.
- Do not import or rely on code from `dbt-core`. 
- Aim to release a new minor version of your plugin as you add substantial new features. Typically, this will be triggered by adding support for new features released in `dbt-adapters` or by changes to the data platform itself.
- While your plugin is new and you're iterating on features, aim to offer backwards compatibility and deprecation notices for at least one minor version. As your plugin matures, aim to leave backwards compatibility and deprecation notices in place until the next major version (dbt Core v2).
- Release patch versions of your plugins whenever needed. These patch releases should only contain fixes.

:::note

Prior to dbt Core version 1.8, we recommended that the minor version of your plugin should match the minor version in `dbt-core` (for example, 1.1.x).

## Build a new adapter

This step will walk you through the first creating the necessary adapter classes and macros, and provide some resources to help you validate that your new adapter is working correctly. Make sure you've familiarized yourself with the previous steps in this guide.

Once the adapter is passing most of the functional tests in the previous "Testing a new adapter" step, please let the community know that is available to use by adding the adapter to the ["Supported Data Platforms"](/docs/supported-data-platforms) page by following the steps given in "Documenting your adapter.

For any questions you may have, don't hesitate to ask in the [#adapter-ecosystem](https://getdbt.slack.com/archives/C030A0UF5LM) Slack channel. The community is very helpful and likely has experienced a similar issue as you.

### Scaffolding a new adapter

 To create a new adapter plugin from scratch, you can use the [dbt-database-adapter-scaffold](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-database-adapter-scaffold) to trigger an interactive session which will generate a scaffolding for you to build upon.

    Example usage:

    ```
    $ cookiecutter gh:dbt-labs/dbt-database-adapter-scaffold
    ```

The generated boilerplate starting project will include a basic adapter plugin file structure, examples of macros, high level method descriptions, etc.

One of the most important choices you will make during the cookiecutter generation will revolve around the field for `is_sql_adapter` which is a boolean used to correctly apply imports for either a `SQLAdapter` or `BaseAdapter`. Knowing which you will need requires a deeper knowledge of your selected database but a few good guides for the choice are.

- Does your database have a complete SQL API? Can it perform tasks using SQL such as creating schemas, dropping schemas, querying an `information_schema` for metadata calls? If so, it is more likely to be a SQLAdapter where you set `is_sql_adapter` to `True`.
- Most adapters do fall under SQL adapters which is why we chose it as the default `True` value.
- It is very possible to build out a fully functional `BaseAdapter`. This will require a little more ground work as it doesn't come with some prebuilt methods the `SQLAdapter` class provides. See `dbt-bigquery` as a good guide.

### Implementation details

Regardless if you decide to use the cookiecutter template or manually create the plugin, this section will go over each method that is required to be implemented. The following table provides a high-level overview of the classes, methods, and macros you may have to define for your data platform.

|File  | Component     | <div style={{width:'200px'}}>Purpose</div>    |
| ---- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `./setup.py`              | `setup()` function           | adapter meta-data (package name, version, author, homepage, etc)   |
| `myadapter/dbt/adapters/myadapter/__init__.py`    | `AdapterPlugin`  | bundle all the information below into a dbt plugin |
| `myadapter/dbt/adapters/myadapter/connections.py` | `MyAdapterCredentials` class  | parameters to connect to and configure the database, via a the chosen Python driver  |
| `myadapter/dbt/adapters/myadapter/connections.py` | `MyAdapterConnectionManager` class  | telling dbt how to interact with the database w.r.t opening/closing connections, executing queries, and fetching data. Effectively a wrapper around the db API or driver.  |
| `myadapter/dbt/include/bigquery/` | a dbt project of macro "overrides" in the format of "myadapter__" | any differences in SQL syntax for regular db operations will be modified here from the global_project (e.g. "Create Table As Select", "Get all relations in the current schema", etc) |
| `myadapter/dbt/adapters/myadapter/impl.py`        | `MyAdapterConfig` | database- and relation-level configs and   |
| `myadapter/dbt/adapters/myadapter/impl.py`        | `MyAdapterAdapter`            | for changing _how_ dbt performs operations like macros and other needed Python functionality    |
| `myadapter/dbt/adapters/myadapter/column.py`   | `MyAdapterColumn`  | for defining database-specific column such as datatype mappings  |


### Editing `setup.py`

Edit the file at `myadapter/setup.py` and fill in the missing information.

You can skip this step if you passed the arguments for `email`, `url`, `author`, and `dependencies` to the cookiecutter template script. If you plan on having nested macro folder structures, you may need to add entries to `package_data` so your macro source files get installed.

### Editing the connection manager

Edit the connection manager at `myadapter/dbt/adapters/myadapter/connections.py`. This file is defined in the sections below.

#### The Credentials class

The credentials class defines all of the database-specific credentials (e.g. `username` and `password`) that users will need in the [connection profile](/docs/supported-data-platforms) for your new adapter. Each credentials contract should subclass dbt.adapters.base.Credentials, and be implemented as a python dataclass.

Note that the base class includes required database and schema fields, as dbt uses those values internally.

For example, if your adapter requires a host, integer port, username string, and password string, but host is the only required field, you'd add definitions for those new properties to the class as types, like this:

<File name='connections.py'>

```python

from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Optional

from dbt.adapters.base import Credentials


@dataclass
class MyAdapterCredentials(Credentials):
    host: str
    port: int = 1337
    username: Optional[str] = None
    password: Optional[str] = None

    @property
    def type(self):
        return 'myadapter'

    @property
    def unique_field(self):
        """
        Hashed and included in anonymous telemetry to track adapter adoption.
        Pick a field that can uniquely identify one team/organization building with this adapter
        """
        return self.host

    def _connection_keys(self):
        """
        List of keys to display in the `dbt debug` output.
        """
        return ('host', 'port', 'database', 'username')
```

</File>

There are a few things you can do to make it easier for users when connecting to your database:

- Be sure to implement the Credentials' `_connection_keys` method shown above. This method will return the keys that should be displayed in the output of the `dbt debug` command. As a general rule, it's good to return all the arguments used in connecting to the actual database except the password (even optional arguments).
- Create a `profile_template.yml` to enable configuration prompts for a brand-new user setting up a connection profile via the [`dbt init` command](/reference/commands/init). You will find more details in the following steps.
- You may also want to define an `ALIASES` mapping on your Credentials class to include any config names you want users to be able to use in place of 'database' or 'schema'. For example if everyone using the MyAdapter database calls their databases "collections", you might do:

<File name='connections.py'>

```python
@dataclass
class MyAdapterCredentials(Credentials):
    host: str
    port: int = 1337
    username: Optional[str] = None
    password: Optional[str] = None

    ALIASES = {
        'collection': 'database',
    }
```

</File>

Then users can use `collection` OR `database` in their `profiles.yml`, `dbt_project.yml`, or `config()` calls to set the database.

#### `ConnectionManager` class methods

Once credentials are configured, you'll need to implement some connection-oriented methods. They are enumerated in the SQLConnectionManager docstring, but an overview will also be provided here.

**Methods to implement:**

- `open`
- `get_response`
- `cancel`
- `exception_handler`
- `standardize_grants_dict`

##### `open(cls, connection)`

`open()` is a classmethod that gets a connection object (which could be in any state, but will have a `Credentials` object with the attributes you defined above) and moves it to the 'open' state.

Generally this means doing the following:
    - if the connection is open already, log and return it.
        - If a database needed changes to the underlying connection before re-use, that would happen here
    - create a connection handle using the underlying database library using the credentials
        - on success:
            - set connection.state to `'open'`
            - set connection.handle to the handle object
                - this is what must have a `cursor()` method that returns a cursor!
        - on error:
            - set connection.state to `'fail'`
            - set connection.handle to `None`
            - raise a `dbt.exceptions.FailedToConnectException` with the error and any other relevant information

For example:

<File name='connections.py'>

```python
    @classmethod
    def open(cls, connection):
        if connection.state == 'open':
            logger.debug('Connection is already open, skipping open.')
            return connection

        credentials = connection.credentials

        try:
            handle = myadapter_library.connect(
                host=credentials.host,
                port=credentials.port,
                username=credentials.username,
                password=credentials.password,
                catalog=credentials.database
            )
            connection.state = 'open'
            connection.handle = handle
        return connection
```

</File>

##### `get_response(cls, cursor)`

`get_response` is a classmethod that gets a cursor object and returns adapter-specific information about the last executed command. The return value should be an `AdapterResponse` object that includes items such as `code`, `rows_affected`, `bytes_processed`, and a summary `_message` for logging to stdout.

<File name='connections.py'>

```python
    @classmethod
    def get_response(cls, cursor) -> AdapterResponse:
        code = cursor.sqlstate or "OK"
        rows = cursor.rowcount
        status_message = f"{code} {rows}"
        return AdapterResponse(
            _message=status_message,
            code=code,
            rows_affected=rows
        )
```

</File>

##### `cancel(self, connection)`

`cancel` is an instance method that gets a connection object and attempts to cancel any ongoing queries, which is database dependent. Some databases don't support the concept of cancellation, they can simply implement it via 'pass' and their adapter classes should implement an `is_cancelable` that returns False - On ctrl+c connections may remain running. This method must be implemented carefully, as the affected connection will likely be in use in a different thread.

<File name='connections.py'>

```python
    def cancel(self, connection):
        tid = connection.handle.transaction_id()
        sql = 'select cancel_transaction({})'.format(tid)
        logger.debug("Cancelling query '{}' ({})".format(connection_name, pid))
        _, cursor = self.add_query(sql, 'master')
        res = cursor.fetchone()
        logger.debug("Canceled query '{}': {}".format(connection_name, res))
```

</File>

##### `exception_handler(self, sql, connection_name='master')`

`exception_handler` is an instance method that returns a context manager that will handle exceptions raised by running queries, catch them, log appropriately, and then raise exceptions dbt knows how to handle.

If you use the (highly recommended) `@contextmanager` decorator, you only have to wrap a `yield` inside a `try` block, like so:

<File name='connections.py'>

```python
    @contextmanager
    def exception_handler(self, sql: str):
        try:
            yield
        except myadapter_library.DatabaseError as exc:
            self.release(connection_name)

            logger.debug('myadapter error: {}'.format(str(e)))

##### `standardize_grants_dict(self, grants_table: agate.Table) -> dict`

`standardize_grants_dict` is an method that returns the dbt-standardized grants dictionary that matches how users configure grants now in dbt. The input is the result of `SHOW GRANTS ON {{model}}` call loaded into an agate table.

If there's any massaging of agate table containing the results, of `SHOW GRANTS ON {{model}}`, that can't easily be accomplished in SQL, it can be done here. For example, the SQL to show grants _should_ filter OUT any grants TO the current user/role (e.g. OWNERSHIP). If that's not possible in SQL, it can be done in this method instead.

<File name='impl.py'>

```python
    @available
    def standardize_grants_dict(self, grants_table: agate.Table) -> dict:
        """
        :param grants_table: An agate table containing the query result of
            the SQL returned by get_show_grant_sql
        :return: A standardized dictionary matching the `grants` config
        :rtype: dict
        """
        grants_dict: Dict[str, List[str]] = {}
        for row in grants_table:
            grantee = row["grantee"]
            privilege = row["privilege_type"]
            if privilege in grants_dict.keys():
                grants_dict[privilege].append(grantee)
            else:
                grants_dict.update({privilege: [grantee]})
        return grants_dict

### Editing the adapter implementation

Edit the connection manager at `myadapter/dbt/adapters/myadapter/impl.py`

Very little is required to implement the adapter itself. On some adapters, you will not need to override anything. On others, you'll likely need to override some of the ``convert_*`` classmethods, or override the `is_cancelable` classmethod on others to return `False`.

#### `datenow()`

This classmethod provides the adapter's canonical date function. This is not used but is required– anyway on all adapters.

<File name='impl.py'>

```python
    @classmethod
    def date_function(cls):
        return 'datenow()'
```

</File>

### Editing SQL logic

dbt implements specific SQL operations using jinja macros. While reasonable defaults are provided for many such operations (like `create_schema`, `drop_schema`, `create_table`, etc), you may need to override one or more of macros when building a new adapter.

#### Required macros

The following macros must be implemented, but you can override their behavior for your adapter using the "dispatch" pattern described below. Macros marked (required) do not have a valid default implementation, and are required for dbt to operate.

- `alter_column_type` ([source](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/f988f76fccc1878aaf8d8631c05be3e9104b3b9a/core/dbt/include/global_project/macros/adapters/columns.sql#L37-L55))
- `check_schema_exists` ([source](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/f988f76fccc1878aaf8d8631c05be3e9104b3b9a/core/dbt/include/global_project/macros/adapters/metadata.sql#L43-L55))
- `create_schema` ([source](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/f988f76fccc1878aaf8d8631c05be3e9104b3b9a/core/dbt/include/global_project/macros/adapters/schema.sql#L1-L9))
- `drop_relation` ([source](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/f988f76fccc1878aaf8d8631c05be3e9104b3b9a/core/dbt/include/global_project/macros/adapters/relation.sql#L34-L42))
- `drop_schema` ([source](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/f988f76fccc1878aaf8d8631c05be3e9104b3b9a/core/dbt/include/global_project/macros/adapters/schema.sql#L12-L20))
- `get_columns_in_relation` ([source](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/f988f76fccc1878aaf8d8631c05be3e9104b3b9a/core/dbt/include/global_project/macros/adapters/columns.sql#L1-L8)) (required)
- `list_relations_without_caching` ([source](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/f988f76fccc1878aaf8d8631c05be3e9104b3b9a/core/dbt/include/global_project/macros/adapters/metadata.sql#L58-L65)) (required)
- `list_schemas` ([source](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/f988f76fccc1878aaf8d8631c05be3e9104b3b9a/core/dbt/include/global_project/macros/adapters/metadata.sql#L29-L40))
- `rename_relation` ([source](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/f988f76fccc1878aaf8d8631c05be3e9104b3b9a/core/dbt/include/global_project/macros/adapters/relation.sql#L56-L65))
- `truncate_relation` ([source](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/f988f76fccc1878aaf8d8631c05be3e9104b3b9a/core/dbt/include/global_project/macros/adapters/relation.sql#L45-L53))
- `current_timestamp` ([source](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/f988f76fccc1878aaf8d8631c05be3e9104b3b9a/core/dbt/include/global_project/macros/adapters/freshness.sql#L1-L8)) (required)
- `copy_grants`

#### Adapter dispatch

Most modern databases support a majority of the standard SQL spec. There are some databases that _do not_ support critical aspects of the SQL spec however, or they provide their own nonstandard mechanisms for implementing the same functionality. To account for these variations in SQL support, dbt provides a mechanism called [multiple dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch) for macros. With this feature, macros can be overridden for specific adapters. This makes it possible to implement high-level methods (like "create <Term id="table" />") in a database-specific way.

<File name='adapters.sql'>

```jinja2

{# dbt will call this macro by name, providing any arguments #}
{% macro create_table_as(temporary, relation, sql) -%}

  {# dbt will dispatch the macro call to the relevant macro #}
  {{ return(
      adapter.dispatch('create_table_as')(temporary, relation, sql)
     ) }}
{%- endmacro %}



{# If no macro matches the specified adapter, "default" will be used #}
{% macro default__create_table_as(temporary, relation, sql) -%}
   ...
{%- endmacro %}



{# Example which defines special logic for Redshift #}
{% macro redshift__create_table_as(temporary, relation, sql) -%}
   ...
{%- endmacro %}



{# Example which defines special logic for BigQuery #}
{% macro bigquery__create_table_as(temporary, relation, sql) -%}
   ...
{%- endmacro %}
```

</File>

The `adapter.dispatch()` macro takes a second argument, `packages`, which represents a set of "search namespaces" in which to find potential implementations of a dispatched macro. This allows users of community-supported adapters to extend or "shim" dispatched macros from common packages, such as `dbt-utils`, with adapter-specific versions in their own project or other installed packages. See:

- "Shim" package examples: [`spark-utils`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/spark-utils), [`tsql-utils`](https://github.com/dbt-msft/tsql-utils)
- [`adapter.dispatch` docs](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/dispatch)

#### Overriding adapter methods

While much of dbt's adapter-specific functionality can be modified in adapter macros, it can also make sense to override adapter methods directly. In this example, assume that a database does not support a `cascade` parameter to `drop schema`. Instead, we can implement an approximation where we drop each relation and then drop the schema.

<File name='impl.py'>

```python
    def drop_schema(self, relation: BaseRelation):
        relations = self.list_relations(
            database=relation.database,
            schema=relation.schema
        )
        for relation in relations:
            self.drop_relation(relation)
        super().drop_schema(relation)
```

</File>

#### Grants Macros

See [this GitHub discussion](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/discussions/5468) for information on the macros required for `GRANT` statements:

### Behavior change flags

Starting in `dbt-adapters==1.5.0` and `dbt-core==1.8.7`, adapter maintainers can implement their own behavior change flags. Refer to [Behavior changes](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/global-configs/behavior-changes) for more information. 

Behavior Flags are not intended to be long-living feature flags. They should be implemented with the expectation that the behavior will be the default within an expected period of time. To implement a behavior change flag, you must provide a name for the flag, a default setting (`True` / `False`), an optional source, and a description and/or a link to the flag's documentation on docs.getdbt.com. 

We recommend having a description and documentation link whenever possible. The description and/or docs should provide end users context for why the flag exists, why they may see a warning, and why they may want to utilize the behavior flag. Behavior change flags can be implemented by overwriting `_behavior_flags()` on the adapter in `impl.py`:

<File name='impl.py'>

```python
class ABCAdapter(BaseAdapter):
    ...
    @property
    def _behavior_flags(self) -> List[BehaviorFlag]:
        return [
            {
                "name": "enable_new_functionality_requiring_higher_permissions",
                "default": False,
                "source": "dbt-abc",
                "description": (
                    "The dbt-abc adapter is implementing a new method for sourcing metadata. "
                    "This is a more performant way for dbt to source metadata but requires higher permissions on the platform. "
                    "Enabling this without granting the requisite permissions will result in an error. "
                    "This feature is expected to be required by Spring 2025."
                ),
                "docs_url": "https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/global-configs/behavior-changes#abc-enable_new_functionality_requiring_higher_permissions",
            }
        ]
```

</File>

Once a behavior change flag has been implemented, it can be referenced on the adapter both in `impl.py` and in Jinja macros:

<File name='impl.py'>

```python
class ABCAdapter(BaseAdapter):
    ...
    def some_method(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.behavior.enable_new_functionality_requiring_higher_permissions:
            # do the new thing
        else:
            # do the old thing
```

</File>

<File name='adapters.sql'>

```sql
{% macro some_macro(**kwargs) %}
    {% if adapter.behavior.enable_new_functionality_requiring_higher_permissions %}
        {# do the new thing #}
    {% else %}
        {# do the old thing #}
    {% endif %}
{% endmacro %}
```

</File>

Every time the behavior flag evaluates to `False,` it warns the user, informing them that a change will occur in the future.

This warning doesn't display when the flag evaluates to `True` as the user is already in the new experience.

Recognizing that the warnings can be disruptive and are not always necessary, you can evaluate the flag without triggering the warning. Simply append `.no_warn` to the end of the flag.


<File name='impl.py'>

```python
    class ABCAdapter(BaseAdapter):
        ...
        def some_method(self, *args, **kwargs):
            if self.behavior.enable_new_functionality_requiring_higher_permissions.no_warn:
                # do the new thing
            else:
                # do the old thing
```

</File>

<File name='adapters.sql'>

```sql
{% macro some_macro(**kwargs) %}
    {% if adapter.behavior.enable_new_functionality_requiring_higher_permissions.no_warn %}
        {# do the new thing #}
    {% else %}
        {# do the old thing #}
    {% endif %}
{% endmacro %}
```

</File>

It's best practice to evaluate a behavior flag as few times as possible. This will make it easier to remove once the behavior change has matured.

As a result, evaluating the flag earlier in the logic flow is easier. Then, take either the old or the new path. While this may create some duplication in code, using behavior flags in this way provides a safer way to implement a change, which we are already admitting is risky or even breaking in nature.

### Other files

#### `profile_template.yml`

In order to enable the [`dbt init` command](/reference/commands/init) to prompt users when setting up a new project and connection profile, you should include a **profile template**. The filepath needs to be `dbt/include/<adapter_name>/profile_template.yml`. It's possible to provide hints, default values, and conditional prompts based on connection methods that require different supporting attributes. Users will also be able to include custom versions of this file in their own projects, with fixed values specific to their organization, to support their colleagues when using your dbt adapter for the first time.

See examples:

- [dbt-postgres](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/main/plugins/postgres/dbt/include/postgres/profile_template.yml)
- [dbt-redshift](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-redshift/blob/main/dbt/include/redshift/profile_template.yml)
- [dbt-snowflake](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-snowflake/blob/main/dbt/include/snowflake/profile_template.yml)
- [dbt-bigquery](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-bigquery/blob/main/dbt/include/bigquery/profile_template.yml)

#### `__version__.py`

To assure that `dbt --version` provides the latest dbt core version the adapter supports, be sure include a `__version__.py` file. The filepath will be `dbt/adapters/<adapter_name>/__version__.py`. We recommend using the latest dbt core version and as the adapter is made compatible with later versions, this file will need to be updated. For a sample file, check out this [example](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-snowflake/blob/main/dbt/adapters/snowflake/__version__.py).

It should be noted that both of these files are included in the bootstrapped output of the `dbt-database-adapter-scaffold` so when using the scaffolding, these files will be included.

## Test your adapter

This document has two sections:

1. Refer to "About the testing framework" for a description of the standard framework that we maintain for using pytest together with dbt. It includes an example that shows the anatomy of a simple test case.
2. Refer to "Testing your adapter" for a step-by-step guide for using our out-of-the-box suite of "basic" tests, which will validate that your adapter meets a baseline of dbt functionality.

### Testing prerequisites

- Your adapter must be compatible with dbt-core **v1.1** or newer
- You should be familiar with **pytest**: [https://docs.pytest.org](https://docs.pytest.org)

### About the testing framework

[dbt-adapters-tests](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/tree/main/dbt-tests-adapter) offers a standard framework for running prebuilt functional tests, and for defining your own tests. The core testing framework is built using `pytest`, a mature and standard library for testing Python projects.

It includes basic utilities for setting up pytest + dbt. These are used by all "prebuilt" functional tests, and make it possible to quickly write your own tests.

Those utilities allow you to do three basic things:

1. **Quickly set up a dbt "project."** Define project resources via methods such as `models()` and `seeds()`. Use `project_config_update()` to pass configurations into `dbt_project.yml`.
2. **Define a sequence of dbt commands.** The most important utility  is `run_dbt()`, which returns the [results](/reference/dbt-classes#result-objects) of each dbt command. It takes a list of CLI specifiers (subcommand + flags), as well as an optional second argument, `expect_pass=False`, for cases where you expect the command to fail.
3. **Validate the results of those dbt commands.** For example, `check_relations_equal()` asserts that two database objects have the same structure and content. You can also write your own `assert` statements, by inspecting the results of a dbt command, or querying arbitrary database objects with `project.run_sql()`.

You can see the full suite of utilities, with arguments and annotations, in [`util.py`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/main/core/dbt/tests/util.py). You'll also see them crop up across a number of test cases. While all utilities are intended to be reusable, you won't need all of them for every test. In the example below, we'll show a simple test case that uses only a few utilities.

#### Example: a simple test case

This example will show you the anatomy of a test case using dbt + pytest. We will create reusable components, combine them to form a dbt "project", and define a sequence of dbt commands. Then, we'll use Python `assert` statements to ensure those commands succeed (or fail) as we expect.

In ["Getting started running basic tests,"](#getting-started-running-basic-tests) we'll offer step-by-step instructions for installing and configuring `pytest`, so that you can run it on your own machine. For now, it's more important to see how the pieces of a test case fit together.

This example includes a seed, a model, and two tests—one of which will fail.

1. Define Python strings that will represent the file contents in your dbt project. Defining these in a separate file enables you to reuse the same components across different test cases. The pytest name for this type of reusable component is "fixture."

<File name="tests/functional/example/fixtures.py">

```python
# seeds/my_seed.csv
my_seed_csv = """
id,name,some_date
1,Easton,1981-05-20T06:46:51
2,Lillian,1978-09-03T18:10:33
3,Jeremiah,1982-03-11T03:59:51
4,Nolan,1976-05-06T20:21:35
""".lstrip()

# models/my_model.sql
my_model_sql = """
select * from {{ ref('my_seed') }}
union all
select null as id, null as name, null as some_date
"""

# models/my_model.yml
my_model_yml = """
version: 2
models:
  - name: my_model
    columns:
      - name: id
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null  # this test will fail
"""
```

</File>

2. Use the "fixtures" to define the project for your test case. These fixtures are always scoped to the **class**, where the class represents one test case—that is, one dbt project or scenario. (The same test case can be used for one or more actual tests, which we'll see in step 3.) Following the default pytest configurations, the file name must begin with `test_`, and the class name must begin with `Test`.

<File name="tests/functional/example/test_example_failing_test.py">

```python
import pytest
from dbt.tests.util import run_dbt

# our file contents
from tests.functional.example.fixtures import (
    my_seed_csv,
    my_model_sql,
    my_model_yml,
)

# class must begin with 'Test'
class TestExample:
    """
    Methods in this class will be of two types:
    1. Fixtures defining the dbt "project" for this test case.
       These are scoped to the class, and reused for all tests in the class.
    2. Actual tests, whose names begin with 'test_'.
       These define sequences of dbt commands and 'assert' statements.
    """
    
    # configuration in dbt_project.yml
    @pytest.fixture(scope="class")
    def project_config_update(self):
        return {
          "name": "example",
          "models": {"+materialized": "view"}
        }

    # everything that goes in the "seeds" directory
    @pytest.fixture(scope="class")
    def seeds(self):
        return {
            "my_seed.csv": my_seed_csv,
        }

    # everything that goes in the "models" directory
    @pytest.fixture(scope="class")
    def models(self):
        return {
            "my_model.sql": my_model_sql,
            "my_model.yml": my_model_yml,
        }
        
    # continues below
```

</File>

3. Now that we've set up our project, it's time to define a sequence of dbt commands and assertions. We define one or more methods in the same file, on the same class (`TestExampleFailingTest`), whose names begin with `test_`. These methods share the same setup (project scenario) from above, but they can be run independently by pytest—so they shouldn't depend on each other in any way.

<File name="tests/functional/example/test_example_failing_test.py">

```python
    # continued from above

    # The actual sequence of dbt commands and assertions
    # pytest will take care of all "setup" + "teardown"
    def test_run_seed_test(self, project):
        """
        Seed, then run, then test. We expect one of the tests to fail
        An alternative pattern is to use pytest "xfail" (see below)
        """
        # seed seeds
        results = run_dbt(["seed"])
        assert len(results) == 1
        # run models
        results = run_dbt(["run"])
        assert len(results) == 1
        # test tests
        results = run_dbt(["test"], expect_pass = False) # expect failing test
        assert len(results) == 2
        # validate that the results include one pass and one failure
        result_statuses = sorted(r.status for r in results)
        assert result_statuses == ["fail", "pass"]

    @pytest.mark.xfail
    def test_build(self, project):
        """Expect a failing test"""
        # do it all
        results = run_dbt(["build"])
```

</File>

3. Our test is ready to run! The last step is to invoke `pytest` from your command line. We'll walk through the actual setup and configuration of `pytest` in the next section.

<File name="terminal">

```sh
$ python3 -m pytest tests/functional/test_example.py
=========================== test session starts ============================
platform ... -- Python ..., pytest-..., pluggy-...
rootdir: ...
plugins: ...

tests/functional/test_example.py .X                                  [100%]

======================= 1 passed, 1 xpassed in 1.38s =======================
```

</File>

You can find more ways to run tests, along with a full command reference, in the [pytest usage docs](https://docs.pytest.org/how-to/usage.html).

We've found the `-s` flag (or `--capture=no`) helpful to print logs from the underlying dbt invocations, and to step into an interactive debugger if you've added one. You can also use environment variables to set [global dbt configs](/reference/global-configs/about-global-configs), such as `DBT_DEBUG` (to show debug-level logs).

### Testing this adapter

Anyone who installs `dbt-core`, and wishes to define their own test cases, can use the framework presented in the first section. The framework is especially useful for testing standard dbt behavior across different databases.

To that end, we have built and made available a [package of reusable adapter test cases](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/tree/main/dbt-tests-adapter), for creators and maintainers of adapter plugins. These test cases cover basic expected functionality, as well as functionality that frequently requires different implementations across databases.

For the time being, this package is also located within the `dbt-core` repository, but separate from the `dbt-core` Python package.

### Categories of tests

In the course of creating and maintaining your adapter, it's likely that you will end up implementing tests that fall into three broad categories:

1. **Basic tests** that every adapter plugin is expected to pass. These are defined in `tests.adapter.basic`. Given differences across data platforms, these may require slight modification or reimplementation. Significantly overriding or disabling these tests should be with good reason, since each represents basic functionality expected by dbt users. For example, if your adapter does not support incremental models, you should disable the test, [by marking it with `skip` or `xfail`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/skipping.html), as well as noting that limitation in any documentation, READMEs, and usage guides that accompany your adapter.

2. **Optional tests**, for second-order functionality that is common across plugins, but not required for basic use. Your plugin can opt into these test cases by inheriting existing ones, or reimplementing them with adjustments. For now, this category includes all tests located outside the `basic` subdirectory. More tests will be added as we convert older tests defined on dbt-core and mature plugins to use the standard framework.

3. **Custom tests**, for behavior that is specific to your adapter / data platform. Each <Term id="data-warehouse" /> has its own specialties and idiosyncracies. We encourage you to use the same `pytest`-based framework, utilities, and fixtures to write your own custom tests for functionality that is unique to your adapter.

If you run into an issue with the core framework, or the basic/optional test cases—or if you've written a custom test that you believe would be relevant and useful for other adapter plugin developers—please open an issue or PR in the `dbt-core` repository on GitHub.

### Getting started running basic tests

In this section, we'll walk through the three steps to start running our basic test cases on your adapter plugin:

1. Install dependencies
2. Set up and configure pytest
3. Define test cases

### Install dependencies

You should already have a virtual environment with `dbt-core` and your adapter plugin installed. You'll also need to install:

- [`pytest`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/)
- [`dbt-tests-adapter`](https://pypi.org/project/dbt-tests-adapter/), the set of common test cases
- (optional) [`pytest` plugins](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/reference/plugin_list.html)--we'll use `pytest-dotenv` below

Or specify all dependencies in a requirements file like:
<File name="dev_requirements.txt">

```txt
pytest
pytest-dotenv
dbt-tests-adapter
```

</File>

```sh
python -m pip install -r dev_requirements.txt
```

### Set up and configure pytest

First, set yourself up to run `pytest` by creating a file named `pytest.ini` at the root of your repository:

<File name="pytest.ini">

```python
[pytest]
filterwarnings =
    ignore:.*'soft_unicode' has been renamed to 'soft_str'*:DeprecationWarning
    ignore:unclosed file .*:ResourceWarning
env_files =
    test.env  # uses pytest-dotenv plugin
              # this allows you to store env vars for database connection in a file named test.env
              # rather than passing them in every CLI command, or setting in `PYTEST_ADDOPTS`
              # be sure to add "test.env" to .gitignore as well!
testpaths =
    tests/functional  # name per convention
```

</File>

Then, create a configuration file within your tests directory. In it, you'll want to define all necessary profile configuration for connecting to your data platform in local development and continuous integration. We recommend setting these values with environment variables, since this file will be checked into version control.

<File name="tests/conftest.py">

```python
import pytest
import os

# Import the standard functional fixtures as a plugin
# Note: fixtures with session scope need to be local
pytest_plugins = ["dbt.tests.fixtures.project"]

# The profile dictionary, used to write out profiles.yml
# dbt will supply a unique schema per test, so we do not specify 'schema' here
@pytest.fixture(scope="class")
def dbt_profile_target():
    return {
        'type': '<myadapter>',
        'threads': 1,
        'host': os.getenv('HOST_ENV_VAR_NAME'),
        'user': os.getenv('USER_ENV_VAR_NAME'),
        ...
    }
```

</File>

### Define test cases

As in the example above, each test case is defined as a class, and has its own "project" setup. To get started, you can import all basic test cases and try running them without changes.

<File name="tests/functional/adapter/test_basic.py">

```python
import pytest

from dbt.tests.adapter.basic.test_base import BaseSimpleMaterializations
from dbt.tests.adapter.basic.test_singular_tests import BaseSingularTests
from dbt.tests.adapter.basic.test_singular_tests_ephemeral import BaseSingularTestsEphemeral
from dbt.tests.adapter.basic.test_empty import BaseEmpty
from dbt.tests.adapter.basic.test_ephemeral import BaseEphemeral
from dbt.tests.adapter.basic.test_incremental import BaseIncremental
from dbt.tests.adapter.basic.test_generic_tests import BaseGenericTests
from dbt.tests.adapter.basic.test_snapshot_check_cols import BaseSnapshotCheckCols
from dbt.tests.adapter.basic.test_snapshot_timestamp import BaseSnapshotTimestamp
from dbt.tests.adapter.basic.test_adapter_methods import BaseAdapterMethod

class TestSimpleMaterializationsMyAdapter(BaseSimpleMaterializations):
    pass


class TestSingularTestsMyAdapter(BaseSingularTests):
    pass


class TestSingularTestsEphemeralMyAdapter(BaseSingularTestsEphemeral):
    pass


class TestEmptyMyAdapter(BaseEmpty):
    pass


class TestEphemeralMyAdapter(BaseEphemeral):
    pass


class TestIncrementalMyAdapter(BaseIncremental):
    pass


class TestGenericTestsMyAdapter(BaseGenericTests):
    pass


class TestSnapshotCheckColsMyAdapter(BaseSnapshotCheckCols):
    pass


class TestSnapshotTimestampMyAdapter(BaseSnapshotTimestamp):
    pass


class TestBaseAdapterMethod(BaseAdapterMethod):
    pass
```

</File>

Finally, run pytest:

```sh
python3 -m pytest tests/functional
```

### Modifying test cases

You may need to make slight modifications in a specific test case to get it passing on your adapter. The mechanism to do this is simple: rather than simply inheriting the "base" test with `pass`, you can redefine any of its fixtures or test methods.

For instance, on Redshift, we need to explicitly cast a column in the fixture input seed to use data type `varchar(64)`:

<File name="tests/functional/adapter/test_basic.py">

```python
import pytest
from dbt.tests.adapter.basic.files import seeds_base_csv, seeds_added_csv, seeds_newcolumns_csv
from dbt.tests.adapter.basic.test_snapshot_check_cols import BaseSnapshotCheckCols

# set the datatype of the name column in the 'added' seed so it
# can hold the '_update' that's added
schema_seed_added_yml = """
version: 2
seeds:
  - name: added
    config:
      column_types:
        name: varchar(64)
"""

class TestSnapshotCheckColsRedshift(BaseSnapshotCheckCols):
    # Redshift defines the 'name' column such that it's not big enough
    # to hold the '_update' added in the test.
    @pytest.fixture(scope="class")
    def models(self):
        return {
            "base.csv": seeds_base_csv,
            "added.csv": seeds_added_csv,
            "seeds.yml": schema_seed_added_yml,
        }
```

</File>

As another example, the `dbt-bigquery` adapter asks users to "authorize" replacing a <Term id="table" /> with a <Term id="view" /> by supplying the `--full-refresh` flag. The reason: In the table <Term id="materialization" /> logic, a view by the same name must first be dropped; if the table query fails, the model will be missing.

Knowing this possibility, the "base" test case offers a `require_full_refresh` switch on the `test_config` fixture class. For BigQuery, we'll switch it on:

<File name="tests/functional/adapter/test_basic.py">

```python
import pytest
from dbt.tests.adapter.basic.test_base import BaseSimpleMaterializations

class TestSimpleMaterializationsBigQuery(BaseSimpleMaterializations):
    @pytest.fixture(scope="class")
    def test_config(self):
        # effect: add '--full-refresh' flag in requisite 'dbt run' step
        return {"require_full_refresh": True}
```

</File>

It's always worth asking whether the required modifications represent gaps in perceived or expected dbt functionality. Are these simple implementation details, which any user of this database would understand? Are they limitations worth documenting?

If, on the other hand, they represent poor assumptions in the "basic" test cases, which fail to account for a common pattern in other types of databases-—please open an issue or PR in the `dbt-core` repository on GitHub.

### Running with multiple profiles

Some databases support multiple connection methods, which map to actually different functionality behind the scenes. For instance, the `dbt-spark` adapter supports connections to Apache Spark clusters _and_ Databricks runtimes, which supports additional functionality out of the box, enabled by the Delta file format.

<File name="tests/conftest.py">

```python
def pytest_addoption(parser):
    parser.addoption("--profile", action="store", default="apache_spark", type=str)


# Using @pytest.mark.skip_profile('apache_spark') uses the 'skip_by_profile_type'
# autouse fixture below
def pytest_configure(config):
    config.addinivalue_line(
        "markers",
        "skip_profile(profile): skip test for the given profile",
    )

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def dbt_profile_target(request):
    profile_type = request.config.getoption("--profile")
    elif profile_type == "databricks_sql_endpoint":
        target = databricks_sql_endpoint_target()
    elif profile_type == "apache_spark":
        target = apache_spark_target()
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid profile type '{profile_type}'")
    return target

def apache_spark_target():
    return {
        "type": "spark",
        "host": "localhost",
        ...
    }

def databricks_sql_endpoint_target():
    return {
        "type": "spark",
        "host": os.getenv("DBT_DATABRICKS_HOST_NAME"),
        ...
    }

@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def skip_by_profile_type(request):
    profile_type = request.config.getoption("--profile")
    if request.node.get_closest_marker("skip_profile"):
        for skip_profile_type in request.node.get_closest_marker("skip_profile").args:
            if skip_profile_type == profile_type:
                pytest.skip("skipped on '{profile_type}' profile")
```

</File>

If there are tests that _shouldn't_ run for a given profile:

<File name="tests/functional/adapter/basic.py">

```python
# Snapshots require access to the Delta file format, available on our Databricks connection,
# so let's skip on Apache Spark
@pytest.mark.skip_profile('apache_spark')
class TestSnapshotCheckColsSpark(BaseSnapshotCheckCols):
    @pytest.fixture(scope="class")
    def project_config_update(self):
        return {
            "seeds": {
                "+file_format": "delta",
            },
            "snapshots": {
                "+file_format": "delta",
            }
        }
```

</File>

Finally:

```sh
python3 -m pytest tests/functional --profile apache_spark
python3 -m pytest tests/functional --profile databricks_sql_endpoint
```

## Document a new adapter

If you've already built, and tested your adapter, it's time to document it so the dbt community will know that it exists and how to use it.

### Making your adapter available

Many community members maintain their adapter plugins under open source licenses. If you're interested in doing this, we recommend:

- Hosting on a public git provider (for example, GitHub or Gitlab)
- Publishing to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/)
- Adding to the list of ["Supported Data Platforms"](/docs/supported-data-platforms#community-supported) (more info below)

### General Guidelines

To best inform the dbt community of the new adapter, you should contribute to the dbt's open-source documentation site, which uses the [Docusaurus project](https://docusaurus.io/). This is the site you're currently on!

### Conventions

Each `.md` file you create needs a header as shown below. The document id will also need to be added to the config file: `website/sidebars.js`.

```md
---
title: "Documenting a new adapter"
id: "documenting-a-new-adapter"
---
```

### Single Source of Truth

We ask our adapter maintainers to use the [docs.getdbt.com repo](https://github.com/dbt-labs/docs.getdbt.com) (i.e. this site) as the single-source-of-truth for documentation rather than having to maintain the same set of information in three different places. The adapter repo's `README.md` and the data platform's documentation pages should simply link to the corresponding page on this docs site. Keep reading for more information on what should and shouldn't be included on the dbt docs site.

### Assumed Knowledge

To simplify things, assume the reader of this documentation already knows how both dbt and your data platform works. There's already great material for how to learn dbt and the data platform out there. The documentation we're asking you to add should be what a user who is already profiecient in both dbt and your data platform would need to know in order to use both. Effectively that boils down to two things: how to connect, and how to configure.

### Topics and Pages to Cover

The following subjects need to be addressed across three pages of this docs site to have your data platform be listed on our documentation. After the corresponding pull request is merged, we ask that you link to these pages from your adapter repo's `README` as well as from your product documentation.

To contribute, all you will have to do make the changes listed in the table below.

| How To...    | File to change within `/website/docs/`     | Action | <div style={{width:'200px'}}>Info to include</div>         |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------|
| Connect              | `/docs/core/connect-data-platform/{MY-DATA-PLATFORM}-setup.md` | Create | Give all information needed to define a target in `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` and get `dbt debug` to connect to the database successfully. All possible configurations should be mentioned.             |
| Configure            | `reference/resource-configs/{MY-DATA-PLATFORM}-configs.md`   | Create | What options and configuration specific to your data platform do users need to know? e.g. table distribution and indexing options, column_quoting policy, which incremental strategies are supported |
| Discover and Install | `docs/supported-data-platforms.md`                                 | Modify | Is it a vendor- or community- supported adapter? How to install Python adapter package? Ideally with pip and PyPI hosted package, but can also use `git+` link to GitHub Repo                             |
| Add link to sidebar  | `website/sidebars.js`                                        | Modify | Add the document id to the correct location in the sidebar menu                                                                                                                                      |

For example say I want to document my new adapter: `dbt-ders`. For the "Connect" page, I will make a new Markdown file, `ders-setup.md` and add it to the `/website/docs/core/connect-data-platform/` directory.

### Example PRs to add new adapter documentation

Below are some recent pull requests made by partners to document their data platform's adapter:

- [TiDB](https://github.com/dbt-labs/docs.getdbt.com/pull/1309)
- [SingleStore](https://github.com/dbt-labs/docs.getdbt.com/pull/1044)
- [Firebolt](https://github.com/dbt-labs/docs.getdbt.com/pull/941)

Note &mdash; Use the following re-usable component to auto-fill the frontmatter content on your new page:

```markdown
import SetUpPages from '/snippets/_setup-pages-intro.md';

<SetUpPages meta={frontMatter.meta} />
```

## Promote a new adapter

The most important thing here is recognizing that people are successful in the community when they join, first and foremost, to engage authentically.

What does authentic engagement look like? It’s challenging to define explicit rules. One good rule of thumb is to treat people with dignity and respect.

Contributors to the community should think of contribution _as the end itself,_ not a means toward other business KPIs (leads, community members, etc.). [We are a mission-driven company.](https://www.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/values/) Some ways to know if you’re authentically engaging:

- Is an engagement’s _primary_ purpose of sharing knowledge and resources or building brand engagement?
- Imagine you didn’t work at the org you do &mdash; can you imagine yourself still writing this?
- Is it written in formal / marketing language, or does it sound like you, the human?

### Who should join the dbt community slack?

- People who have insight into what it means to do hands-on [analytics engineering](https://www.getdbt.com/analytics-engineering/) work
  The dbt Community Slack workspace is fundamentally a place for analytics practitioners to interact with each other &mdash; the closer the users are in the community to actual data/analytics engineering work, the more natural their engagement will be (leading to better outcomes for partners and the community).

- DevRel practitioners with strong focus
  DevRel practitioners often have a strong analytics background and a good understanding of the community. It’s essential to be sure they are focused on _contributing,_ not on driving community metrics for partner org (such as signing people up for their slack or events). The metrics will rise naturally through authentic engagement.

- Founder and executives who are interested in directly engaging with the community
  This is either incredibly successful or not at all depending on the profile of the founder. Typically, this works best when the founder has a practitioner-level of technical understanding and is interested in joining not to promote, but to learn and hear from users.

- Software Engineers at partner products that are building and supporting integrations with either dbt Core or dbt Cloud
  This is successful when the engineers are familiar with dbt as a product or at least have taken our training course. The Slack is often a place where end-user questions and feedback is initially shared, so it is recommended that someone technical from the team be present. There are also a handful of channels aimed at those building integrations, which tend to be a font of knowledge.

### Who might struggle in the dbt community

- People in marketing roles
  dbt Slack is not a marketing channel. Attempts to use it as such invariably fall flat and can even lead to people having a negative view of a product. This doesn’t mean that dbt can’t serve marketing objectives, but a long-term commitment to engagement is the only proven method to do this sustainably.

- People in product roles
  The dbt Community can be an invaluable source of feedback on a product. There are two primary ways this can happen &mdash; organically (community members proactively suggesting a new feature) and via direct calls for feedback and user research. Immediate calls for engagement must be done in your dedicated #tools channel. Direct calls should be used sparingly, as they can overwhelm more organic discussions and feedback.

### Who is the audience for an adapter release?

  A new adapter is likely to drive huge community interest from several groups of people:
    - People who are currently using the database that the adapter is supporting
    - People who may be adopting the database in the near future.
    - People who are interested in dbt development in general.

The database users will be your primary audience and the most helpful in achieving success. Engage them directly in the adapter’s dedicated Slack channel. If one does not exist already, reach out in #channel-requests, and we will get one made for you and include it in an announcement about new channels.

The final group is where non-slack community engagement becomes important. Twitter and LinkedIn are both great places to interact with a broad audience. A well-orchestrated adapter release can generate impactful and authentic engagement.

### How to message the initial rollout and follow-up content

Tell a story that engages dbt users and the community. Highlight new use cases and functionality unlocked by the adapter in a way that will resonate with each segment.

- Existing users of your technology who are new to dbt
  - Provide a general overview of the value dbt will deliver to your users. This can lean on dbt's messaging and talking points which are laid out in the [dbt viewpoint.](/community/resources/viewpoint)
  - Give examples of a rollout that speaks to the overall value of dbt and your product.

- Users who are already familiar with dbt and the community
  - Consider unique use cases or advantages your adapter provide over existing adapters. Who will be excited for this?
  - Contribute to the dbt Community and ensure that dbt users on your adapter are well supported (tutorial content, packages, documentation, etc).
  - Example of a rollout that is compelling for those familiar with dbt: [Firebolt](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6879090752459182080/)

### Tactically manage distribution of content about new or existing adapters

There are tactical pieces on how and where to share that help ensure success.

- On slack:
  - #i-made-this channel &mdash; this channel has a policy against “marketing” and “content marketing” posts, but it should be successful if you write your content with the above guidelines in mind. Even with that, it’s important to post here sparingly.
  - Your own database / tool channel &mdash; this is where the people who have opted in to receive communications from you and always a great place to share things that are relevant to them.

- On social media:
  - Twitter
  - LinkedIn
  - Social media posts _from the author_ or an individual connected to the project tend to have better engagement than posts from a company or organization account.
  - Ask your partner representative about:
    - Retweets and shares from the official dbt Labs accounts.
    - Flagging posts internally at dbt Labs to get individual employees to share.

#### Measuring engagement

You don’t need 1000 people in a channel to succeed, but you need at least a few active participants who can make it feel lived in. If you’re comfortable working in public, this could be members of your team, or it can be a few people who you know that are highly engaged and would be interested in participating. Having even 2 or 3 regulars hanging out in a channel is all that’s needed for a successful start and is, in fact, much more impactful than 250 people that never post.

### How to announce a new adapter

We’d recommend _against_ boilerplate announcements and encourage finding a unique voice. That being said, there are a couple of things that we’d want to include:

- A summary of the value prop of your database / technology for users who aren’t familiar.
- The personas that might be interested in this news.
- A description of what the adapter _is_.  For example:
  > With the release of our new dbt adapter, you’ll be able to to use dbt to model and transform your data in [name-of-your-org]
- Particular or unique use cases or functionality unlocked by the adapter.
- Plans for future / ongoing support / development.
- The link to the documentation for using the adapter on the dbt Labs docs site.
- An announcement blog.

#### Announcing new release versions of existing adapters

This can vary substantially depending on the nature of the release but a good baseline is the types of release messages that [we put out in the #dbt-releases](https://getdbt.slack.com/archives/C37J8BQEL/p1651242161526509) channel.

## Build a trusted adapter

The Trusted Adapter Program exists to allow adapter maintainers to demonstrate to the dbt community that your adapter is trusted to be used in production.

The very first data platform dbt supported was Redshift followed quickly by Postgres ([dbt-core#174](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/pull/174)). In 2017, back when dbt Labs (née Fishtown Analytics) was still a data consultancy, we added support for Snowflake and BigQuery. We also turned dbt's database support into an adapter framework ([dbt-core#259](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/pull/259/)), and a plugin system a few years later. For years, dbt Labs specialized in those four data platforms and became experts in them. However, the surface area of all possible databases, their respective nuances, and keeping them up-to-date and bug-free is a Herculean and/or Sisyphean task that couldn't be done by a single person or even a single team! Enter the dbt community which enables dbt Core to work on more than 30 different databases (32 as of Sep '22)!

Free and open-source tools for the data professional are increasingly abundant. This is by-and-large a _good thing_, however it requires due dilligence that wasn't required in a paid-license, closed-source software world. Before taking a dependency on an open-source projet is is important to determine the answer to the following questions:

1. Does it work?
2. Does it meet my team's specific use case?
3. Does anyone "own" the code, or is anyone liable for ensuring it works?
4. Do bugs get fixed quickly?
5. Does it stay up-to-date with new Core features?
6. Is the usage substantial enough to self-sustain?
7. What risks do I take on by taking a dependency on this library?

These are valid, important questions to answer—especially given that `dbt-core` itself only put out its first stable release (major version v1.0) in December 2021! Indeed, up until now, the majority of new user questions in database-specific channels are some form of:

- "How mature is `dbt-<ADAPTER>`? Any gotchas I should be aware of before I start exploring?"
- "has anyone here used `dbt-<ADAPTER>` for production models?"
- "I've been playing with  `dbt-<ADAPTER>` -- I was able to install and run my initial experiments. I noticed that there are certain features mentioned on the documentation that are marked as 'not ok' or 'not tested'. What are the risks?
I'd love to make a statement on my team to adopt DBT [sic], but I'm pretty sure questions will be asked around the possible limitations of the adapter or if there are other companies out there using dbt [sic] with Oracle DB in production, etc."

There has been a tendency to trust the dbt Labs-maintained adapters over community- and vendor-supported adapters, but repo ownership is only one among many indicators of software quality. We aim to help our users feel well-informed as to the caliber of an adapter with a new program.

### What it means to be trusted

By opting into the below, you agree to this, and we take you at your word. dbt Labs reserves the right to remove an adapter from the trusted adapter list at any time, should any of the below guidelines not be met.

### Feature Completeness

To be considered for the Trusted Adapter Program, the adapter must cover the essential functionality of dbt Core given below, with best effort given to support the entire feature set.

Essential functionality includes (but is not limited to the following features):

- table, view, and seed materializations
- dbt tests

The adapter should have the required documentation for connecting and configuring the adapter. The dbt docs site should be the single source of truth for this information. These docs should be kept up-to-date.

Proceed to the "Document a new adapter" step for more information.

### Release cadence

Keeping an adapter up-to-date with the latest features of dbt, as defined in [dbt-adapters](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters), is an integral part of being a trusted adapter. We encourage adapter maintainers to keep track of new dbt-adapter releases and support new features relevant to their platform, ensuring users have the best version of dbt. 

Before [dbt Core version 1.8](/docs/dbt-versions/core-upgrade/upgrading-to-v1.8#new-dbt-core-adapter-installation-procedure), adapter versions needed to match the semantic versioning of dbt Core. After v1.8, this is no longer required. This means users can use an adapter on v1.8+ with a different version of dbt Core v1.8+. For example, a user could use dbt-core v1.9 with dbt-postgres v1.8. 

### Community responsiveness

On a best effort basis, active participation and engagement with the dbt Community across the following forums:

- Being responsive to feedback and supporting user enablement in dbt Community’s Slack workspace
- Responding with comments to issues raised in public dbt adapter code repository
- Merging in code contributions from community members as deemed appropriate

### Security Practices

Trusted adapters will not do any of the following:

- Output to logs or file either access credentials information to or data from the underlying data platform itself.
- Make API calls other than those expressly required for using dbt features (adapters may not add additional logging)
- Obfuscate code and/or functionality so as to avoid detection

Additionally, to avoid supply-chain attacks:

- Use an automated service to keep Python dependencies up-to-date (such as  Dependabot or similar),
- Publish directly to PyPI from the dbt adapter code repository by using trusted CI/CD process (such as GitHub actions)
- Restrict admin access to both the respective code (GitHub) and package (PyPI) repositories
- Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities by use of a static code analyzing tool (such as Snyk) as part of a CI/CD process

### Other considerations

The adapter repository is:

- open-souce licensed,
- published to PyPI, and
- automatically tests the codebase against dbt Lab's provided adapter test suite

### How to get an adapter on the trusted list

Open an issue on the [docs.getdbt.com GitHub repository](https://github.com/dbt-labs/docs.getdbt.com) using the "Add adapter to Trusted list" template. In addition to contact information, it will ask confirm that you agree to the following.

1. my adapter meet the guidelines given above
2. I will make best reasonable effort that this continues to be so
3. checkbox: I acknowledge that dbt Labs reserves the right to remove an adapter from the trusted adapter list at any time, should any of the above guidelines not be met.

The approval workflow is as follows:

1. create and populate the template-created issue
2. dbt Labs will respond as quickly as possible (maximally four weeks, though likely faster)
3. If approved, dbt Labs will create and merge a Pull request to formally add the adapter to the list.
