## Breaking changes

There are no breaking changes for code in dbt projects and packages. We are committed to providing backward compatibility for all versions 1.x. If you encounter an error upon upgrading, please let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/new).

### For users of dbt Metrics

The names of metric properties have changed, with backward compatibility. Those changes are:
- Renamed `type` to `calculation_method`
- Renamed `sql` to `expression` 
- Renamed `expression` calculation method metrics to `derived` calculation method metrics

We plan to keep backward compatibility for a full minor version. Defining metrics with the old names will raise an error in dbt Core v1.4.

### For consumers of dbt artifacts (metadata)

We have updated the manifest schema version to `v7`. This includes the changes to metrics described above and a few other changes related to the addition of Python models:
- Renamed `raw_sql` to `raw_code`
- Renamed `compiled_sql` to `compiled_code`
- A new top-level node property, `language` (`'sql'` or `'python'`)

For users of [state-based selection](understanding-state): This release includes logic providing backward and forward compatibility for older manifest versions. While running dbt Core v1.3, it should be possible to use `state:modified --state ...` selection against a manifest produced by dbt Core v1.0 and higher.

### For maintainers of adapter plugins

_GitHub discussion forthcoming_

**Notes:**
- The `statement` and `create_table_as` macros accept a new argument, `language`, with a default value of `'sql'`

## New and changed documentation

- **[Python models](building-models/python-models)** are natively supported in `dbt-core` for the first time, on data warehouses that support Python runtimes.
- Updates made to **[Metrics](building-a-dbt-project/metrics)** reflect their new syntax for definition, as well as additional properties that are now available.
- Plus, a few related updates to **[exposure properties](exposure-properties)**: `config`, `label`, and `name` validation.
- **[Custom `node_color`](/docs/reference/resource-configs/docs.md)** in `dbt-docs`. For the first time, you can control the colors displayed in dbt's DAG. Want bronze, silver, and gold layers? It's at your fingertips.
- Search for **[`Profiles.yml`](/docs/dbt-cli/configure-your-profile#advanced-customizing-a-profile-directory)** in the current working directory before `~/.dbt`

### Quick hits
- **["Full refresh"](full_refresh)** flag supports a short name, `-f`.
- **[The "config" selection method](methods#the-config-method)** supports boolean and list config values, in addition to strings.
- Two new dbt-Jinja context variables for accessing invocation metadata: [`invocation_args_dict`](flags#invocation_args_dict) and [`dbt_metadata_envs`](env_var#custom-metadata).
