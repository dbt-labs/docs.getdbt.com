title: "Upgrading to v0.21"

---

:::caution Unsupported version
dbt Core v0.21 has reached the end of critical support. No new patch versions will be released, and it will stop running in dbt Cloud on June 30, 2022. Read ["About dbt Core versions"](/docs/dbt-versions/core) for more details.
:::

### Resources

- [Discourse](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/3077)
- [Release notes](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/releases/tag/v0.21.0)
- [Full changelog](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/0.21.latest/CHANGELOG.md)

## Breaking changes

- `dbt source snapshot-freshness` has been renamed to `dbt source freshness`. Its node selection logic is now consistent with other tasks. In order to check freshness for a specific source, you must prefix it with `source:`.
- **Snowflake:** Turn off transactions and turn on `autocommit` by default. Within dbt materializations, wrap [DML statements](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44796508) in explicit `begin` and `commit`. Note that it is not recommended to run <Term id="dml" /> statements outside of dbt <Term id="materialization" /> logic. If you do this, despite our recommendation, you will need to wrap those statements in explicit `begin` and `commit`. Note also that this may affect user-space code that depends on transactions, such as pre-hooks and post-hooks that specify `transaction: true` or `transaction: false`. We recommend removing those references to transactions.
- **Artifacts:**
    - [`manifest.json`](/reference/artifacts/manifest-json) uses a `v3` schema that includes additional node properties (no changes to existing properties)
    - [`run_results.json`](/reference/artifacts/run-results-json) uses a `v3` schema that has added `skipped` as a potential `TestResult`
    - [`sources.json`](/reference/artifacts/sources-json) has a new `v2` schema that has added timing and thread details

## New and changed documentation

### Tasks
- [Commands](/reference/dbt-commands), [`build`](/reference/commands/build), [rpc](/reference/commands/rpc): Add `dbt build`
- [Commands: `source`](/reference/commands/source): Renamed to `dbt source freshness`.
- [`deps`](/reference/commands/deps): Add `dbt deps` logging for outdated packages
- [`list`](/reference/commands/list): Add `--output-keys` flag and RPC parameter

## Selection
- [Commands: `source`](/reference/commands/source): Updated selection logic to match other tasks. When selecting a specific source to check freshness, you must prefix it with `source:`.
- [Node selection syntax](/reference/node-selection/syntax), [commands](/reference/dbt-commands): Switch `--models` for `--select` across the board. (Commands which previously used the `--models` flag still support it for backwards compatibility.)
- [YAML selectors](/reference/node-selection/yaml-selectors#default) now support an optional `default` property. If set, dbt will use custom selection criteria for commands that do not specify their own selection/exclusion flags.
- [Selection methods](/reference/node-selection/methods) and [state comparison caveats](/reference/node-selection/state-comparison-caveats): Add `state:modified` subselectors, and reflect that it now includes changes to upstream macros.
- [Test selection examples](/reference/node-selection/test-selection-examples) includes more discussion of indirect selection (a change in v0.20), and the optional "greedy" flag/property (new in v0.21), which you can optionally set to include tests that have a mix of selected + unselected parents

### Elsewhere in Core
- [Resource configs and properties](/reference/configs-and-properties) docs have been consolidated and reconciled. New `config` property that makes it possible to configure models, seeds, snapshots, and tests in all YAML files.
- [Configuring incremental models](/docs/build/incremental-models): New optional configuration for incremental models, `on_schema_change`.
- [Environment variables](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/env_var): Add a log-scrubbing prefix, `DBT_ENV_SECRET_`
- [Test `where` config](/reference/resource-configs/where) has been reimplemented as a macro (`get_where_subquery`) that you can optionally reimplement, too
- [`dispatch`](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/dispatch) now supports reimplementing global macros residing in the `dbt` macro namespace with versions from installed packages, by leveraging `search_order` in the [`dispatch` project config](/reference/project-configs/dispatch-config)

### Plugins
- **Postgres** [profile](/reference/warehouse-setups/postgres-setup) property `connect_timeout` now configurable. Also applicable to child plugins (e.g. `dbt-redshift`)
- **Redshift**: [profile](/reference/warehouse-setups/redshift-setup) property `ra3_node: true` to support cross-database source definitions and read-only querying
- **BigQuery**: [profile](/reference/warehouse-setups/bigquery-setup) property `execution_project` now configurable. [Snapshots](/docs/build/snapshots) support `target_project` and `target_dataset` config aliases.
