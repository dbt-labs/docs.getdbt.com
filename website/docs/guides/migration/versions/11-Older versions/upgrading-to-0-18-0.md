### Resources

- [Changelog](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/dev/marian-anderson/CHANGELOG.md)
- [Discussion: Prerelease](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/prerelease-v0-18-0-marian-anderson/1545)

## Breaking changes

Please be aware of the following changes in v0.18.0. While breaking, we do not expect these to affect the majority of projects.

### Adapter macros

- dbt only has access to adapter plugin macros from the currently-in-use adapter or one of its dependencies, rather than all installed adapters in the namespace.
- `adapter_macro` is no longer a macro and will raise a deprecation warning. Use `adapter.dispatch` instead.

### Data tests

- Data tests are written as <Term id="cte">CTEs</Term> instead of <Term id="subquery">subqueries</Term>. Adapter plugins for databases that don't support CTEs may need to override this behavior.

### Python requirements
- Upgraded `snowflake-connector-python` dependency to 2.2.10 and enabled the SSO token cache

## New features

For more details, see [new and changed documentation](#new-and-changed-documentation) below.

:::info [β] Beta Features
There are several pieces of net-new functionality in v0.18.0, with iterative improvements to come. If you encounter unexpected behavior, please post in Slack or open an issue.
:::

### Node selection
- methods: `config`, `test_type`, `test_name`, `package`, [β] `state`
- intersections
- nth-parent/child
- [β] version-controlled YAML selectors
- [β] defer unselected node references to state defined by a previous run's artifacts

### Adapter macros
- `adapter.dispatch` replaces `adapter_macro`, with much greater flexibility
- Schema tests are now defined via `dispatch`, such that non-core plugins
can override schema test definitions

### Docs
- Include static assets (such as images) in auto-generated docs site
- Improved resource search
- Project-level overviews

### Database-specific
- Specify IAM profile when connecting to Redshift
- Snowflake query tags at connection and model level
- Impersonate a BigQuery service account when connecting via oauth
- Adding policy tags to BigQuery columns
- Configure time-to-live for BigQuery tables
