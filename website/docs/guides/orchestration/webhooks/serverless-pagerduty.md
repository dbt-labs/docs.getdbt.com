title: "Create PagerDuty alarms from failed dbt Cloud tasks"
id: webhooks-guide-serverless-pagerduty
slug: serverless-pagerduty
---

This guide will teach you how to build and host a basic Python app which will monitor dbt Cloud jobs and create PagerDuty alarms based on failure. To do this, when a dbt Cloud job completes it will:
 - check for any failed nodes (e.g. non-passing tests or errored models), and
 - create a PagerDuty alarm based on those nodes by calling the PagerDuty Events API. Events are deduplicated per run ID.

In this example, we will use fly.io for hosting/running the service. fly.io is a platform for running full stack apps without provisioning servers etc. This level of usage should comfortably fit inside of the Free tier. You can also use an alternative tool such as [AWS Lambda](https://adem.sh/blog/tutorial-fastapi-aws-lambda-serverless) or [Google Cloud Run](https://github.com/sekR4/FastAPI-on-Google-Cloud-Run).

## Prerequisites
This guide assumes some familiarity with:
- [dbt Cloud Webhooks](/docs/deploy/webhooks)
- CLI apps
- Deploying code to a serverless code runner like fly.io or AWS Lambda

## Integration steps

### 1. Clone the `dbt-cloud-webhooks-pagerduty` repo

[This repository](https://github.com/dpguthrie/dbt-cloud-webhooks-pagerduty) contains the sample code for validating a webhook and creating events in PagerDuty.


### 2. Install `flyctl` and sign up for fly.io

Follow the directions for your OS in the [fly.io docs](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/), then from your command line, run the following commands: 

Switch to the directory containing the repo you cloned in step 1:
```shell
#example: replace with your actual path
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/dbt-cloud-webhooks-pagerduty
```

Sign up for fly.io:
```shell
flyctl auth signup
```

Your console should show `successfully logged in as YOUR_EMAIL` when you're done, but if it doesn't then sign in to fly.io from your command line:
```shell
flyctl auth login
```

### 3. Launch your fly.io app
Launching your app publishes it to the web and makes it ready to catch webhook events:
```shell
flyctl launch
```

You will see a message saying that an existing `fly.toml` file was found. Type `y` to copy its configuration to your new app. 

Choose an app name of your choosing, such as `YOUR_COMPANY-dbt-cloud-webhook-pagerduty`, or leave blank and one will be generated for you. Note that your name can only contain numbers, lowercase letters and dashes.

Choose a deployment region, and take note of the hostname that is generated (normally `APP_NAME.fly.dev`). 

When asked if you would like to set up Postgresql or Redis databases, type `n` for each.

Type `y` when asked if you would like to deploy now.

### Create a PagerDuty integration application
See [PagerDuty's guide](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/ZG9jOjExMDI5NTgw-events-api-v2-overview#getting-started) for full instructions. 

Make note of the integration key for later. 

### Configure a new webhook in dbt Cloud
See [Create a webhook subscription](/docs/deploy/webhooks#create-a-webhook-subscription) for full instructions. Your event should be **Run completed**.

Set the webhook URL to the host name you created earlier (`APP_NAME.fly.dev`)

Make note of the Webhook Secret Key for later.

*Do not test the endpoint*; it won't work until you have stored the auth keys (next step)

### Store secrets
The application requires three secrets to be set, using these names:
- `DBT_CLOUD_SERVICE_TOKEN`: a dbt Cloud [user token](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/user-tokens) or [service account token](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/service-tokens) with at least the `Metdata Only` permission.
- `DBT_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKEN`: the Secret Key for the dbt Cloud webhook you created earlier.
- `PD_ROUTING_KEY`: the integration key for the PagerDuty integration you created earlier.

Set these secrets as follows, replacing `abc123` etc with actual values:
```shell
flyctl secrets set DBT_CLOUD_SERVICE_TOKEN=abc123 DBT_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKEN=def456 PD_ROUTING_KEY=ghi789
```

After you run this command, fly.io will redeploy your application. When it has completed successfully, go back to the dbt Cloud webhook settings and click **Test Endpoint**.
