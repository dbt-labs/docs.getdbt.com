In this guide, you will learn how to set up dbt Cloud using a sample project and one of the most common data platforms. You can select from [BigQuery](/guides/getting-started/getting-set-up/setting-up-bigquery), [Databricks](/guides/getting-started/getting-set-up/setting-up-databricks), [Redshift](/guides/getting-started/getting-set-up/setting-up-redshift), or [Snowflake](/guides/getting-started/getting-set-up/setting-up-snowflake). If you're not sure, then try [BigQuery](/guides/getting-started/getting-set-up/setting-up-bigquery). 

If you'd rather edit and run files locally using the dbt command line interface (dbt CLI) to connect to dbt Core, then you can refer to [Getting started using dbt Core](/guides/getting-started/learning-more/getting-started-dbt-core).
