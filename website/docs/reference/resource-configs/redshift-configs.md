## Performance Optimizations

### Using sortkey and distkey

Tables in Amazon Redshift have two powerful optimizations to improve query performance: distkeys and sortkeys. Supplying these values as model-level configurations apply the corresponding settings in the generated `CREATE TABLE` <Term id="ddl" />. Note that these settings will have no effect for models set to `view` or `ephemeral` models.

- `dist` can have a setting of `all`, `even`, `auto`, or the name of a key.
- `sort` accepts a list of sort keys, for example: `['timestamp', 'userid']`. dbt will build the sort key in the same order the fields are supplied.
- `sort_type` can have a setting of `interleaved` or `compound`. if no setting is specified, sort_type defaults to `compound`.

Sort and dist keys should be added to the `{{ config(...) }}` block in model `.sql` files, eg:

<File name='my_model.sql'>

```sql
-- Example with one sort key
{{ config(materialized='table', sort='id', dist='received_at') }}

select ...


-- Example with multiple sort keys
{{ config(materialized='table', sort=['id', 'category'], dist='received_at') }}

select ...


-- Example with interleaved sort keys
{{ config(materialized='table',
          sort_type='interleaved'
          sort=['id', 'category'],
          dist='received_at')
}}

select ...
```

## Late Binding Views

Redshift supports <Term id="view">views</Term> unbound from their dependencies, or [late binding views](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_CREATE_VIEW.html#late-binding-views). This DDL option "unbinds" a view from the data it selects from. In practice, this means that if upstream views or tables are dropped with a cascade qualifier, the late-binding view does not get dropped as well.

Using late-binding views in a production deployment of dbt can vastly improve the availability of data in the warehouse, especially for models that are materialized as late-binding views and are queried by end-users, since they won’t be dropped when upstream models are updated. Additionally, late binding views can be used with [external tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_CREATE_EXTERNAL_TABLE.html) via Redshift Spectrum.

To materialize a dbt model as a late binding view, use the `bind: false` configuration option:

<File name='my_view.sql'>

```sql
{{ config(materialized='view', bind=False) }}

select *
from source.data
```

</File>

To make all views late-binding, configure your `dbt_project.yml` file like this:

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yaml
models:
  +bind: false # Materialize all views as late-binding
  project_name:
    ....
```

</File>

## Query tags

[Query tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_query_group.html) are a Redshift
parameter that can be quite useful later on when searching in the [SVL_QLOG view](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_SVL_QLOG.html). Please be aware that Redshift uses the term `query_group` when querying the `SVL_QLOG` view.

dbt supports setting a default query tag for the duration of its Redshift connections in
[your profile](/reference/warehouse-setups/redshift-setup). You can set more precise values (and override the default) for subsets of models by setting
a `query_tag` model config or by overriding the default `set_query_tag` macro:

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yaml
models:
  [<resource-path>](resource-path):
    +query_tag: dbt_special

```

</File>

<File name='models/<modelname>.sql'>

```sql
{{ config(
    query_tag = 'dbt_special'
) }}

select ...

```
  
In this example, you can set up a query tag to be applied to every query with the model's name. 
  
```sql 

  {% macro set_query_tag() -%}
  {% set new_query_tag = model.name %} 
  {% if new_query_tag %}
    {% set original_query_tag = get_current_query_tag() %}
    {{ log("Setting query_tag to '" ~ new_query_tag ~ "'. Will reset to '" ~ original_query_tag ~ "' after materialization.") }}
    {% do run_query("set query_group to '{}'".format(new_query_tag)) %}
    {{ return(original_query_tag)}}
  {% endif %}
  {{ return(none)}}
{% endmacro %}

```

**Note:** query tags are set at the _session_ level. At the start of each model <Term id="materialization" />, if the model has a custom `query_tag` configured, dbt will run `alter session set query_tag` to set the new value. At the end of the materialization, dbt will run another `alter` statement to reset the tag to its default value. As such, build failures midway through a materialization may result in subsequent queries running with an incorrect tag.
