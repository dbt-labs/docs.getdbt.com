To-do:
- use the reference doc structure for this article/split into separate articles
- think about whether some of these should be outside of models

## Incremental materialization strategies

In dbt-redshift, the following incremental materialization strategies are supported:

- `append` (default)
- `merge`
- `delete+insert`

All of these strategies are inheirited via from dbt-postgres.

## Performance optimizations

### Using sortkey and distkey

Tables in Amazon Redshift have two powerful optimizations to improve query performance: distkeys and sortkeys. Supplying these values as model-level configurations apply the corresponding settings in the generated `CREATE TABLE` <Term id="ddl" />. Note that these settings will have no effect for models set to `view` or `ephemeral` models.

- `dist` can have a setting of `all`, `even`, `auto`, or the name of a key.
- `sort` accepts a list of sort keys, for example: `['timestamp', 'userid']`. dbt will build the sort key in the same order the fields are supplied.
- `sort_type` can have a setting of `interleaved` or `compound`. if no setting is specified, sort_type defaults to `compound`.

Sort and dist keys should be added to the `{{ config(...) }}` block in model `.sql` files, eg:

<File name='my_model.sql'>

```sql
-- Example with one sort key
{{ config(materialized='table', sort='id', dist='received_at') }}

select ...


-- Example with multiple sort keys
{{ config(materialized='table', sort=['id', 'category'], dist='received_at') }}

select ...


-- Example with interleaved sort keys
{{ config(materialized='table',
          sort_type='interleaved'
          sort=['id', 'category'],
          dist='received_at')
}}

select ...
```

</File>

## Late Binding Views

Redshift supports <Term id="view">views</Term> unbound from their dependencies, or [late binding views](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_CREATE_VIEW.html#late-binding-views). This DDL option "unbinds" a view from the data it selects from. In practice, this means that if upstream views or tables are dropped with a cascade qualifier, the late-binding view does not get dropped as well.

Using late-binding views in a production deployment of dbt can vastly improve the availability of data in the warehouse, especially for models that are materialized as late-binding views and are queried by end-users, since they won’t be dropped when upstream models are updated. Additionally, late binding views can be used with [external tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_CREATE_EXTERNAL_TABLE.html) via Redshift Spectrum.

To materialize a dbt model as a late binding view, use the `bind: false` configuration option:

<File name='my_view.sql'>

```sql
{{ config(materialized='view', bind=False) }}

select *
from source.data
```

</File>

To make all views late-binding, configure your `dbt_project.yml` file like this:

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yaml
models:
  +bind: false # Materialize all views as late-binding
  project_name:
    ....
```

</File>

## Materialized view

The Redshift adapter supports [materialized views](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/materialized-view-overview.html) and refreshes them for every subsequent `dbt run` that you execute. For more information, see [Refresh Materialized Views](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/materialized-view-refresh.html) in the Redshift docs.

Materialized views support the optional configuration `on_configuration_change` with the following values: 
- `apply` (default) &mdash; attempts to update the existing database object if possible, avoiding a complete rebuild. The `auto_refresh` action can applied without the need to rebuild the materialized view.
- `skip` &mdash; allows runs to continue while also providing a warning that the model was skipped
- `fail` &mdash; forces runs to fail if a change is detected in a materialized view 

You can create a materialized view by editing _one_ of these files:
- the SQL file for your model
- the `dbt_project.yml` configuration file

The following examples create a materialized view: 

<File name='models/YOUR_MODEL_NAME.sql'>

```sql
{{
  config(
    materialized = 'materialized_view',
    on_configuration_change = 'apply',
  )
}}
```

</File>


<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yaml 
models:
  path:
    materialized: materialized_view
```
</File>

### Limitations

We hope to address the following limitations in a future release.
#### Changing materialization from "materialized_view" to table or view

Swapping a materialized view to a table or view is not supported. You must manually drop the existing materialized view in the data warehouse before calling `dbt run` again.

For example, assume that a view, `my_mv.sql`, has already been materialized to the underlying data platform via `dbt run`. If a user then changes the model's config to be `materialized="table"`, they will get an error. The workaround is to execute `DROP MATERIALIZE VIEW my_mv CASCASE` on the data warehouse before trying the model again.
