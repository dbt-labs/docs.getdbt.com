## Transient tables

Snowflake supports the creation of [transient tables](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/tables-temp-transient.html). Snowflake does not preserve a history for these tables, which can result in a measurable reduction of your Snowflake storage costs. Transient tables participate in time travel to a limited degree with a retention period of 1 day by default with no fail-safe period. Weigh these tradeoffs when deciding whether or not to configure your dbt models as `transient`. **By default, all Snowflake tables created by dbt are `transient`.**

### Configuring transient tables in dbt_project.yml

A whole folder (or package) can be configured to be transient (or not) by adding a line to the `dbt_project.yml` file. This config works just like all of the [model configs](model-configs) defined in `dbt_project.yml`.

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yaml
name: my_project

...

models:
  +transient: false
  my_project:
    ...
```

</File>

### Configuring transience for a specific model

A specific model can be configured to be transient by setting the `transient` model config to `true`.

<File name='my_table.sql'>

```sql
{{ config(materialized='table', transient=true) }}

select * from ...
```

</File>

## Query tags

[Query tags](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters.html#query-tag) are a Snowflake
parameter that can be quite useful later on when searching in the [QUERY_HISTORY view](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/query_history.html).

dbt supports setting a default query tag for the duration of its Snowflake connections in
[your profile](/reference/warehouse-setups/snowflake-setup). You can set more precise values (and override the default) for subsets of models by setting
a `query_tag` model config or by overriding the default `set_query_tag` macro:

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yaml
models:
  [<resource-path>](resource-path):
    +query_tag: dbt_special

```

</File>

<File name='models/<modelname>.sql'>

```sql
{{ config(
    query_tag = 'dbt_special'
) }}

select ...

```
  
In this example, you can set up a query tag to be applied to every query with the model's name. 
  
```sql 

  {% macro set_query_tag() -%}
  {% set new_query_tag = model.name %} 
  {% if new_query_tag %}
    {% set original_query_tag = get_current_query_tag() %}
    {{ log("Setting query_tag to '" ~ new_query_tag ~ "'. Will reset to '" ~ original_query_tag ~ "' after materialization.") }}
    {% do run_query("alter session set query_tag = '{}'".format(new_query_tag)) %}
    {{ return(original_query_tag)}}
  {% endif %}
  {{ return(none)}}
{% endmacro %}

```

**Note:** query tags are set at the _session_ level. At the start of each model <Term id="materialization" />, if the model has a custom `query_tag` configured, dbt will run `alter session set query_tag` to set the new value. At the end of the materialization, dbt will run another `alter` statement to reset the tag to its default value. As such, build failures midway through a materialization may result in subsequent queries running with an incorrect tag.

## Merge behavior (incremental models)

The [`incremental_strategy` config](/docs/build/incremental-models#about-incremental_strategy) controls how dbt builds incremental models. By default, dbt will use a [merge statement](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/sql-reference/sql/merge.html) on Snowflake to refresh incremental tables.

Snowflake's `merge` statement fails with a "nondeterministic merge" error if the `unique_key` specified in your model config is not actually unique. If you encounter this error, you can instruct dbt to use a two-step incremental approach by setting the `incremental_strategy` config for your model to `delete+insert`.

## Configuring table clustering

dbt supports [table clustering](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/tables-clustering-keys.html) on Snowflake. To control clustering for a <Term id="table" /> or incremental model, use the `cluster_by` config. When this configuration is applied, dbt will do two things:

1. It will implicitly order the table results by the specified `cluster_by` fields
2. It will add the specified clustering keys to the target table

By using the specified `cluster_by` fields to order the table, dbt minimizes the amount of work required by Snowflake's automatic clustering functionality. If an incremental model is configured to use table clustering, then dbt will also order the staged dataset before merging it into the destination table. As such, the dbt-managed table should always be in a mostly clustered state.

### Using cluster_by

The `cluster_by` config accepts either a string, or a list of strings to use as clustering keys. The following example will create a sessions table that is clustered by the `session_start` column.

<File name='models/events/sessions.sql'>

```sql
{{
  config(
    materialized='table',
    cluster_by=['session_start']
  )
}}

select
  session_id,
  min(event_time) as session_start,
  max(event_time) as session_end,
  count(*) as count_pageviews

from {{ source('snowplow', 'event') }}
group by 1
```

</File>

The code above will be compiled to SQL that looks (approximately) like this:

```sql
create or replace table my_database.my_schema.my_table as (

  select * from (
    select
      session_id,
      min(event_time) as session_start,
      max(event_time) as session_end,
      count(*) as count_pageviews

    from {{ source('snowplow', 'event') }}
    group by 1
  )

  -- this order by is added by dbt in order to create the
  -- table in an already-clustered manner.
  order by session_start

);

 alter table my_database.my_schema.my_table cluster by (session_start);
```

### Automatic clustering

Automatic clustering is [enabled by default in Snowflake today](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-auto-reclustering.html), no action is needed to make use of it. Though there is an `automatic_clustering` config, it has no effect except for accounts with (deprecated) manual clustering enabled.

If [manual clustering is still enabled for your account](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-clustering-manual.html), you can use the `automatic_clustering` config to control whether or not automatic clustering is enabled for dbt models. When `automatic_clustering` is set to `true`, dbt will run an `alter table <table name> resume recluster` query after building the target table.

The `automatic_clustering` config can be specified in the `dbt_project.yml` file, or in a model `config()` block.

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yaml
models:
  +automatic_clustering: true
```

</File>

## Configuring virtual warehouses

The default warehouse that dbt uses can be configured in your [Profile](/reference/profiles.yml) for Snowflake connections. To override the warehouse that is used for specific models (or groups of models), use the `snowflake_warehouse` model configuration. This configuration can be used to specify a larger warehouse for certain models in order to control Snowflake costs and project build times.

The following config uses the `EXTRA_SMALL` warehouse for all models in the project, except for the models in the `clickstream` folder, which are configured to use the `EXTRA_LARGE` warehouse. In this example, all Snapshot models are configured to use the `EXTRA_LARGE` warehouse.

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yaml
name: my_project
version: 1.0.0

...

models:
  +snowflake_warehouse: "EXTRA_SMALL"
  my_project:
    clickstream:
      +snowflake_warehouse: "EXTRA_LARGE"

snapshots:
  +snowflake_warehouse: "EXTRA_LARGE"
```

</File>

## Copying grants

When the `copy_grants` config is set to `true`, dbt will add the `copy grants` <Term id="ddl" /> qualifier when rebuilding tables and <Term id="view">views</Term>. The default value is `false`.

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yaml
models:
  +copy_grants: true
```

</File>

## Secure views

To create a Snowflake [secure view](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/views-secure.html), use the `secure` config for view models. Secure views can be used to limit access to sensitive data. Note: secure views may incur a performance penalty, so you should only use them if you need them.

The following example configures the models in the `sensitive/` folder to be configured as secure views.

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yaml
name: my_project
version: 1.0.0

models:
  my_project:
    sensitive:
      +materialized: view
      +secure: true
```

</File>
