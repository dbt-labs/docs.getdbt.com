:::note

For [versionless](/docs/dbt-versions/core-upgrade/upgrading-to-v1.8#versionless) dbt Cloud accounts and dbt Core v1.9+, this functionality is no longer required. Use the [schema](/reference/resource-configs/schema) config as an alternative to define a custom schema while still respecting the `generate_schema_name` macro. 

:::

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yml
snapshots:
  [<resource-path>](/reference/resource-configs/resource-path):
    +target_schema: string

```

</File>

<File name='snapshots/<filename>.sql'>

```jinja2
{{ config(
      target_schema="string"
) }}

```

</File>

## Description
The schema that dbt should build a [snapshot](/docs/build/snapshots) <Term id="table" /> into. Snapshots build into the same `target_schema`, no matter who is running them.

On **BigQuery**, this is analogous to a `dataset`.

## Default
This is a **required** parameter, no default is provided.

## Examples
### Build all snapshots in a schema named `snapshots`

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yml
snapshots:
  +target_schema: snapshots

```

</File>

### Use a target-aware schema
Use the [`{{ target }}` variable](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/target) to change which schema a snapshot <Term id="table" /> is built in.

Note: consider whether this use-case is right for you, as downstream `refs` will select from the `dev` version of a snapshot, which can make it hard to validate models that depend on snapshots (see above [FAQ](#faqs))

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yml
snapshots:
  +target_schema: "{% if target.name == 'prod' %}snapshots{% else %}{{ target.schema }}{% endif %}"

```

</File>

### Use the same schema-naming behavior as models

Leverage the [`generate_schema_name` macro](/docs/build/custom-schemas) to build snapshots in schemas that follow the same naming behavior as your models.

Notes:
* This macro is not available when configuring from the `dbt_project.yml` file, so must be configured in a snapshot config block.
* Consider whether this use-case is right for you, as downstream `refs` will select from the `dev` version of a snapshot, which can make it hard to validate models that depend on snapshots (see above [FAQ](#faqs))
