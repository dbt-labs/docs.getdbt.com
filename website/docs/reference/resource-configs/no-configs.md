If you were guided to this page from a data platform setup article, it most likely means:

- Setting up the profile is the only action the end-user needs to take on the data platform, or
- The subsequent actions the end-user needs to take are not currently documented

If you'd like to contribute to data platform-specifc configuration information, refer to [Documenting a new adapter](/guides/dbt-ecosystem/adapter-development/5-documenting-a-new-adapter)
