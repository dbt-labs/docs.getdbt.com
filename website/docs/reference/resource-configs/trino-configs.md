## Session properties

In the Starburst/Trino environment, you can set session properties that temporarily modifies the current session you have with the cluster. Refer to [Set Session](https://docs.starburst.io/latest/sql/set-session.html) in the Starburst/Trino docs for more details.

During a dbt connection session, you can use [dbt hooks](/reference/resource-configs/pre-hook-post-hook) to set Starburst/Trino session properties on a specific dbt model. For example: 

```sql
{{
  config(
    pre_hook="set session query_max_run_time='10m'"
  )
}}
```

## Connector properties

You can use Starburst/Trino table properties to configure how you want your data to be represented.

For details on what's supported for each supported data source, refer to either the [Trino Connectors](https://trino.io/docs/current/connector.html) or [Starburst Catalog](https://docs.starburst.io/starburst-galaxy/catalogs/).

For example, this configures the data to materialize as a [Parquet](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-parquet.html) table with partitions: 

```sql
{{
  config(
    materialized='table',
    properties= {
      "format": "'PARQUET'",
      "partitioning": "ARRAY['bucket(id, 2)']",
    }
  )
}}
```

## Seeds and prepared statements

The [dbt seed](/docs/build/seeds) command makes use of prepared statements in [Starburst](https://docs.starburst.io/latest/sql/prepare.html)/[Trino](https://trino.io/docs/current/sql/prepare.html).

Prepared statements are templated SQL statements that you can execute repeatedly with high efficiency. The values are sent in a separate field rather than hard coded in the SQL string itself. This is often how application frontends structure their record `INSERT` statements in the OLTP database backend. Because of this, it's common for prepared statements to have as many placeholder variables (parameters) as there are columns in the destination table.

Most seed files have more than one row, and often thousands of rows. This makes the size of the client request as large as there are parameters.

### Header line length limit in Python HTTP client 

You might run into an error message about header line limit if your prepared statements have too many parameters. This is because the header line limit in Python's HTTP client is `65536` bytes. 

You can avoid this upper limit by converting the large prepared statement into smaller statements. dbt already does this by batching an entire seed file into groups of rows &mdash; one group for a number of rows in the CSV. 

Let's say you have a seed file with 20 columns, 600 rows, and 12,000 parameters. Instead of creating a single prepared statement for this, you can have dbt create four prepared `INSERT` statements with 150 rows and 3,000 parameters.

There's a drawback to grouping your table rows. When there are many columns (parameters) in a seed file, the batch size needs to be very small.

For the `dbt-trino` adapter, the macro for batch size is `trino__get_batch_size()` and its default value is `1000`. To change this default behavior, you can add this macro to your dbt project:

<File name='macros/YOUR_MACRO_NAME.sql'>

```sql
{% macro trino__get_batch_size() %}
  {{ return(10000) }} -- Adjust this number as you see fit
{% endmacro %}
```

</File>

Another way to avoid the header line length limit is to set `prepared_statements_enabled` to `true` in your dbt profile; however, this is considered legacy behavior and can be removed in a future release.

## Materializations
### Table

The `dbt-trino` adapter supports these modes in `table` materialization, which you can configure with `on_table_exists`:

- `rename` &mdash; Creates an intermediate table, renames the target table to the backup one, and renames the intermediate table to the target one.
- `drop` &mdash; Drops and re-creates a table. This overcomes the table rename limitation in AWS Glue.

The recommended `table` materialization uses `on_table_exists = 'rename'` and is also the default. You can change this default configuration by editing _one_ of these files:
- the SQL file for your model
- the `dbt_project.yml` configuration file

The following examples configure `table` materialization to be `drop`: 

<File name='models/YOUR_MODEL_NAME.sql'>

```sql
{{
  config(
    materialized = 'table',
    on_table_exists = 'drop`
  )
}}
```

</File>


<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yaml 
models:
  path:
    materialized: table
    +on_table_exists: drop
```
</File>

If you use `table` materialization and `on_table_exists = 'rename'` with AWS Glue, you might encounter this error message. You can overcome the table rename limitation by using `drop`: 

```sh
TrinoUserError(type=USER_ERROR, name=NOT_SUPPORTED, message="Table rename is not yet supported by Glue service")
```

### View

The `dbt-trino` adapter supports these security modes in `view` materialization, which you can configure with `view_security`:
- `definer`
- `invoker`

For more details about security modes in views, see [Security](https://trino.io/docs/current/sql/create-view.html#security) in the Trino docs.

By default, `view` materialization uses `view_security = 'definer'`. You can change this default configuration by editing _one_ of these files:
- the SQL file for your model
- the `dbt_project.yml` configuration file

For example, these configure the security mode to `invoker`:  

<File name='models/YOUR_MODEL_NAME.sql'>

```sql
{{
  config(
    materialized = 'view',
    view_security = 'invoker'
  )
}}
```

</File>

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yaml 
models:
  path:
    materialized: view
    +view_security: invoker
```
</File>


### Incremental

Using an incremental model limits the amount of data that needs to be transformed, which greatly reduces the runtime of your transformations. This improves performance and reduces compute costs.

```sql
{{
    config(
      materialized = 'incremental', 
      unique_key='<optional>',
      incremental_strategy='<optional>',)
}}
select * from {{ ref('events') }}
{% if is_incremental() %}
  where event_ts > (select max(event_ts) from {{ this }})
{% endif %}
```

Use the `+on_schema_change` property to define how dbt-trino should handle column changes. For more details about this property, see [column changes](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/configuring-incremental-models#what-if-the-columns-of-my-incremental-model-change). 

If your connector doesn't support views, set the `+views_enabled` perperty to `false`.

#### append strategy

The default incremental strategy is `append`. `append` only adds new records based on the condition specified in the `is_incremental()` conditional block.

```sql
{{
    config(
      materialized = 'incremental')
}}
select * from {{ ref('events') }}
{% if is_incremental() %}
  where event_ts > (select max(event_ts) from {{ this }})
{% endif %}
```

#### delete+insert strategy

With the `delete+insert` incremental strategy, you can instruct dbt to use a two-step incremental approach. First, it deletes the records detected through the configured `is_incremental()` block, then re-inserts them.

```sql
{{
    config(
      materialized = 'incremental',
      unique_key='user_id',
      incremental_strategy='delete+insert',
      )
}}
select * from {{ ref('users') }}
{% if is_incremental() %}
  where updated_ts > (select max(updated_ts) from {{ this }})
{% endif %}
```

#### merge strategy

With the `merge` incremental strategy, dbt-trino constructs a [Trino MERGE statement](https://trino.io/docs/current/sql/merge.html) to `insert` new records and `update` existing records, based on the `unique_key` property.

If `unique_key` is not unique, you can use the `delete+insert` strategy instead.

```sql
{{
    config(
      materialized = 'incremental',
      unique_key='user_id',
      incremental_strategy='merge',
      )
}}
select * from {{ ref('users') }}
{% if is_incremental() %}
  where updated_ts > (select max(updated_ts) from {{ this }})
{% endif %}
```

Be aware that there are some Trino connectors that don't support `MERGE` or have limited support.

#### Incremental overwrite on Hive models

If there's a [Hive connector](https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/hive.html) accessing your target incremental model, you can simulate an `INSERT OVERWRITE` statement by using the `insert-existing-partitions-behavior` setting on the Hive connector configuration in Trino:

```ini
<hive-catalog-name>.insert-existing-partitions-behavior=OVERWRITE
```

Below is an example Hive configuration that sets the `OVERWRITE` functionality for a Hive connector called `minio`:

```yaml
trino-incremental-hive:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: trino
      method: none
      user: admin
      password:
      catalog: minio
      schema: tiny
      host: localhost
      port: 8080
      http_scheme: http
      session_properties:
        minio.insert_existing_partitions_behavior: OVERWRITE
      threads: 1
```

`dbt-trino` overwrites existing partitions in the target model that match the staged data. It appends the remaining partitions to the target model. This functionality works on incremental models that use partitioning. For example:  

```sql
{{
    config(
        materialized = 'incremental',
        properties={
          "format": "'PARQUET'",
          "partitioned_by": "ARRAY['day']",
        }
    )
}}
```

### Materialized view

The `dbt-trino` adapter supports [materialized views](https://trino.io/docs/current/sql/create-materialized-view.html) and refreshes them for every subsequent `dbt run` that you execute. For more information, see [REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW](https://trino.io/docs/current/sql/refresh-materialized-view.html) in the Trino docs.

You can also define custom properties for the materialized view through the `properties` config.

This materialization supports the [full_refresh](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/full_refresh) config and flag.
Whenever you want to rebuild your materialized view (for example, when changing underlying SQL query) run `dbt run --full-refresh`.

You can create a materialized view by editing _one_ of these files:
- the SQL file for your model
- the `dbt_project.yml` configuration file

The following examples create a materialized view in Parquet format: 

<File name='models/YOUR_MODEL_NAME.sql'>

```sql
{{
  config(
    materialized = 'materialized_view',
    properties = {
      'format': "'PARQUET'"
    },
  )
}}
```

</File>


<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yaml 
models:
  path:
    materialized: materialized_view
    properties:
      format: "'PARQUET'"
```
</File>

## Snapshots

[Snapshots in dbt](/docs/build/snapshots) depend on the `current_timestamp` macro, which returns a timestamp with millisecond precision (3 digits) by default. There are some connectors for Trino that don't support this timestamp precision (`TIMESTAMP(3) WITH TIME ZONE`), like Iceberg.

To change timestamp precision, you can define your own [macro](/docs/build/jinja-macros). For example, this defines a new `trino__current_timestamp()` macro with microsecond precision (6 digits): 

<File name='macros/YOUR_MACRO_NAME.sql'>

```sql
{% macro trino__current_timestamp() %}
    current_timestamp(6)
{% endmacro %}
```
</File>

## Grants

Use [grants](/reference/resource-configs/grants) to manage access to the datasets you're producing with dbt. You can use grants with [Starburst Enterprise](https://docs.starburst.io/latest/security/biac-overview.html), [Starburst Galaxy](https://docs.starburst.io/starburst-galaxy/security/access-control.html), and Hive ([sql-standard](https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/hive-security.html)).


To implement access permissions, define grants as resource configs on each model, seed, and snapshot. Define the default grants that apply to the entire project in your `dbt_project.yml` and define model-specific grants within each model's SQL or YAML file.
<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yaml
models:
  - name: NAME_OF_YOUR_MODEL
    config:
      grants:
        select: ['reporter', 'bi']
```
</File>
