<VersionBlock lastVersion="1.6">

Access modifiers may be applied to models one-by-one in YAML properties. In v1.5 and v1.6, you are unable to configure `access` for multiple models at once. Upgrade to v1.7 for additional configuration options. A group or subfolder contains models with varying access levels, so when you designate a model with `access: public`, make sure you intend for this behavior.

</VersionBlock>

<VersionBlock firstVersion="1.7">

You can apply access modifiers in config files, including `the dbt_project.yml`, or to models one-by-one in YAML properties. Applying access configs to a subfolder modifies the default for all models in that subfolder, so make sure you intend for this behavior. When setting individual model access, a group or subfolder might contain a variety of access levels, so when you designate a model with `access: public` make sure you intend for this behavior.

There are multiple approaches to configuring access:

In the model configs of `dbt_project.yml`: 

```yaml
models:
  - name: my_public_model
    access: public # Older method, still supported
    
```
Or (but not both)

```yaml
models:
  - name: my_public_model
    config:
      access: public # newly supported in v1.7
    
```

In a subfolder: 
```yaml
models:
  my_project_name:
    subfolder_name:
      +group: <my_group>
      +access: private  # sets default for all models in this subfolder
```

In the model.sql file:

```sql
-- models/my_public_model.sql

{{ config(access = "public") }}

select ...
```

## Definition
The access level of the model you are declaring properties for.

Some models (not all) are designed to be referenced through the [ref](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/ref) function across [groups](/docs/build/groups).

| Access    | Referenceable by              |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| private   | same group                    |
| protected | same project/package          |
| public    | any group, package or project |

If you try to reference a model outside of its supported access, you will see an error:

```shell
dbt run -s marketing_model
...
dbt.exceptions.DbtReferenceError: Parsing Error
  Node model.jaffle_shop.marketing_model attempted to reference node model.jaffle_shop.finance_model, 
  which is not allowed because the referenced node is private to the finance group.
```

## Default

By default, all models are "protected." This means that other models in the same project can reference them.
