title: "Defer"
---

Defer is a powerful feature that makes it possible to run a subset of models or tests in a [sandbox environment](/docs/environments-in-dbt) without having to first build their upstream parents. This can save time and computational resources when you want to test a small number of models in a large project.

<Lightbox src src="/img/docs/reference/defer-diagram.png" width="50%" title="Use 'defer' to modify end-of-pipeline models by pointing to production models, instead of running everything upstream." />

Defer requires that a manifest from a previous dbt invocation be passed to the `--state` flag or env var. Together with the `state:` selection method, these features enable "Slim CI". Read more about [state](/reference/node-selection/syntax#about-node-selection).

An alternative command that accomplishes similar functionality for different use cases is `dbt clone` - see the docs for [clone](/reference/commands/clone#when-to-use-dbt-clone-instead-of-deferral) for more information.

It is possible to use separate state for `state:modified` and `--defer`, by passing paths to different manifests to each of the `--state`/`DBT_STATE` and `--defer-state`/`DBT_DEFER_STATE`. This enables more granular control in cases where you want to compare against logical state from one environment or past point in time, and defer to applied state from a different environment or point in time. If `--defer-state` is not specified, deferral will use the manifest supplied to `--state`. In most cases, you will want to use the same state for both: compare logical changes against production, and also "fail over" to the production environment for unbuilt upstream resources.

### Usage

```shell
dbt run --select [...] --defer --state path/to/artifacts
dbt test --select [...] --defer --state path/to/artifacts
```


<VersionBlock lastVersion="0.20">

```shell
dbt run --models [...] --defer --state path/to/artifacts
dbt test --models [...] --defer --state path/to/artifacts
```

</VersionBlock>

When the `--defer` flag is provided, dbt will resolve `ref` calls differently depending on two criteria:
1. Is the referenced node included in the model selection criteria of the current run?
2. Does the referenced node exist as a database object in the current environment?

If the answer to both is **no**—a node is not included _and_ it does not exist as a database object in the current environment—references to it will use the other namespace instead, provided by the state manifest.

Ephemeral models are never deferred, since they serve as "passthroughs" for other `ref` calls.

When using defer, you may be selecting from production datasets, development datasets, or a mix of both. Note that this can yield unexpected results
- if you apply env-specific limits in dev but not prod, as you may end up selecting more data than you expect
- when executing tests that depend on multiple parents (e.g. `relationships`), since you're testing "across" environments

Deferral requires both `--defer` and `--state` to be set, either by passing flags explicitly or by setting environment variables (`DBT_DEFER` and `DBT_STATE`). If you use dbt Cloud, read about [how to set up CI jobs](/docs/deploy/continuous-integration).


#### Favor state

You can optionally skip the second criterion by passing the `--favor-state` flag. If passed, dbt will favor using the node defined in your `--state` namespace, even if the node exists in the current target.

### Example

In my local development environment, I create all models in my target schema, `dev_alice`. In production, the same models are created in a schema named `prod`.

I access the dbt-generated [artifacts](/docs/deploy/artifacts) (namely `manifest.json`) from a production run, and copy them into a local directory called `prod-run-artifacts`.

### run
I've been working on `model_b`:

<File name='models/model_b.sql'>

```sql
select

    id,
    count(*)

from {{ ref('model_a') }}
group by 1
```

I want to test my changes. Nothing exists in my development schema, `dev_alice`.

</File>

<Tabs
  defaultValue="no_defer"
  values={[
    { label: 'Standard run', value: 'no_defer', },
    { label: 'Deferred run', value: 'yes_defer', },
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="no_defer">

```shell
dbt run --select "model_b"
```

<File name='target/run/my_project/model_b.sql'>

```sql
create or replace view dev_me.model_b as (

    select

        id,
        count(*)

    from dev_alice.model_a
    group by 1

)
```

Unless I had previously run `model_a` into this development environment, `dev_alice.model_a` will not exist, thereby causing a database error.

</File>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yes_defer">

```shell
dbt run --select "model_b" --defer --state prod-run-artifacts
```

<File name='target/run/my_project/model_b.sql'>

```sql
create or replace view dev_me.model_b as (

    select

        id,
        count(*)

    from prod.model_a
    group by 1

)
```

</File>

Because `model_a` is unselected, dbt will check to see if `dev_alice.model_a` exists. If it doesn't exist, dbt will resolve all instances of `{{ ref('model_a') }}` to `prod.model_a` instead.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### test

I also have a `relationships` test that establishes referential integrity between `model_a` and `model_b`:

<File name='models/resources.yml'>

```yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: model_b
    columns:
      - name: id
        tests:
          - relationships:
              to: ref('model_a')
              field: id
```

(A bit silly, since all the data in `model_b` had to come from `model_a`, but suspend your disbelief.)

</File>

<Tabs
  defaultValue="no_defer"
  values={[
    { label: 'Without defer', value: 'no_defer', },
    { label: 'With defer', value: 'yes_defer', },
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="no_defer">

```shell
dbt test --select "model_b"
```

<File name='target/compiled/.../relationships_model_b_id__id__ref_model_a_.sql'>

```sql
select count(*) as validation_errors
from (
    select id as id from dev_alice.model_b
) as child
left join (
    select id as id from dev_alice.model_a
) as parent on parent.id = child.id
where child.id is not null
  and parent.id is null
```

The `relationships` test requires both `model_a` and `model_b`. Because I did not build `model_a` in my previous `dbt run`, `dev_alice.model_a` does not exist and this test query fails.

</File>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yes_defer">

```shell
dbt test --select "model_b" --defer --state prod-run-artifacts
```

<File name='target/compiled/.../relationships_model_b_id__id__ref_model_a_.sql'>

```sql
select count(*) as validation_errors
from (
    select id as id from dev_alice.model_b
) as child
left join (
    select id as id from prod.model_a
) as parent on parent.id = child.id
where child.id is not null
  and parent.id is null
```

</File>

dbt will check to see if `dev_alice.model_a` exists. If it doesn't exist, dbt will resolve all instances of `{{ ref('model_a') }}`, including those in schema tests, to use `prod.model_a` instead. The query succeeds. Whether I really want to test for referential integrity across environments is a different question.
