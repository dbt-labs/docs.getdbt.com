title: "Test selection examples"
---

Test selection works a little differently from other resource selection. This makes it very easy to:
* run tests on a particular model
* run tests on all models in a subdirectory
* run tests on all models upstream / downstream of a model, etc.

Like all resource types, tests can be selected **directly**, by methods and operators that capture one of their attributes: their name, properties, tags, etc.

Unlike other resource types, tests can also be selected **indirectly**. If a selection method or operator includes a test's parent(s), the test will also be selected. [See below](#indirect-selection) for more details.

<Changelog>

* `v0.20.0`: Test selection is no longer greedy for indirect inclusion (ALL parents must be selected for the test to be selected). It is still greedy for indirect exclusion (if ANY parent is excluded, the test is excluded).
* `v0.21.0`: Introduce `--greedy` flag (and `greedy` selector property), to optionally include tests that are indirectly selected and have an unselected parent.
* `v1.0.0`: Renamed the `--greedy` flag/property to `indirect_selection`, and set its default back to "eager" (pre-v0.20). You can achieve the "cautious" behavior introduced in v0.20 by setting the flag/property to `cautious`.

</Changelog>

Test selection is powerful, and we know it can be tricky. To that end, we've included lots of examples below:

### Direct selection

<Changelog>

* `v0.18.0`: Introduced the `test_type` selection method. In previous versions, similar behavior is possible via the `--schema` or `--data` flags.
- `v1.0.0`: Renamed test types: "generic" (formerly "schema") and "singular" (formerly "data"). Removed support for the `--schema` and `--data` flags.

</Changelog>

Run generic tests only:

<VersionBlock firstVersion="0.21">

  ```bash
  $ dbt test --select test_type:generic
  ```

</VersionBlock>
<VersionBlock lastVersion="0.20">

  ```bash
  $ dbt test --models test_type:data
  ```

</VersionBlock>

Run singular tests only:

<VersionBlock firstVersion="0.21">

  ```bash
  $ dbt test --select test_type:singular
  ```

</VersionBlock>
<VersionBlock lastVersion="0.20">

  ```bash
  $ dbt test --models test_type:data
  ```

</VersionBlock>

In both cases, `test_type` checks a property of the test itself. These are forms of "direct" test selection.

### Indirect selection

<VersionBlock firstVersion="0.21">

  ```bash
  $ dbt test --select customers
  $ dbt test --select orders
  ```

</VersionBlock>
<VersionBlock lastVersion="0.20">

  ```bash
  $ dbt test --models customers
  $ dbt test --models orders
  ```

</VersionBlock>

These are examples of "indirect" selection: `customers` and `orders` select models (whether by name or path). Any tests defined on either `customers` or `orders` will be selected indirectly, and thereby included.

 By default, a test will run when ANY parent is selected; we call this "eager" indirect selection. In this example, that would include _any_ test that touches either `customers` or `orders`, even if it touches other models as well.

It is possible to prevent tests from running if one or more of its parents is unselected, however; we call this "cautious" indirect selection. This can be useful in environments when you're only building a subset of your DAG, and you want to avoid test failures by tests that depend on unbuilt resources. (Another way to achieve this is with [deferral](defer)).

With `dbt test --indirect-selection=cautious` (or setting `indirect_selection: cautious` in a [yaml selector](yaml-selectors)) tests will be indirectly selected only if **ALL** of its parents are included by the selection criteria. If any parent is missing, that test won't run. Note that test _exclusion_ is always greedy: if **ANY** parent is explicitly excluded, the test will be excluded as well.

Imagine a `relationships` test between `customers` and `orders`. By default, the selection criteria above would select that test "eagerly." If you opt for "cautious" indirect selection instead, the `relationships` test would _not_ be selected by the criteria above, because one of its parents is unselected. It would be selected indirectly only ("cautiously") if both parents are selected:

```shell
$ dbt test --select customers orders --indirect-selection=cautious
```

<VersionBlock firstVersion="0.21">

  ```bash
  $ dbt test --select customers orders
  ```

</VersionBlock>
<VersionBlock lastVersion="0.20">

  ```bash
  $ dbt test --models customers orders
  ```

</VersionBlock>

 ### Syntax examples

The following examples should feel somewhat familiar if you're used to executing `dbt run` with the `--select` option to build parts of your DAG:

<VersionBlock firstVersion="0.21">

  ```bash
  # Run tests on a model (indirect selection)
  $ dbt test --select customers

  # Run tests on all models in the models/staging/jaffle_shop directory (indirect selection)
  $ dbt test --select staging.jaffle_shop

  # Run tests downstream of a model (note this will select those tests directly!)
  $ dbt test --select stg_customers+

  # Run tests upstream of a model (indirect selection)
  $ dbt test --select +stg_customers

  # Run tests on all models with a particular tag (direct + indirect)
  $ dbt test --select tag:my_model_tag

  # Run tests on all models with a particular materialization (indirect selection)
  $ dbt test --select config.materialized:table

  ```

</VersionBlock>
<VersionBlock lastVersion="0.20">

  ```bash
  # Run tests on a model (indirect selection)
  $ dbt test --models customers

  # Run tests on all models in the models/staging/jaffle_shop directory (indirect selection)
  $ dbt test --models staging.jaffle_shop

  # Run tests downstream of a model (note this will select those tests directly!)
  $ dbt test --models stg_customers+

  # Run tests upstream of a model (indirect selection)
  $ dbt test --models +stg_customers

  # Run tests on all models with a particular tag (direct + indirect)
  $ dbt test --models tag:my_model_tag

  # Run tests on all models with a particular materialization (indirect selection)
  $ dbt test --models config.materialized:table

  ```

</VersionBlock>

 The same principle can be extended to tests defined on other resource types. In these cases, we will execute all tests defined on certain sources via the `source:` selection method:

<VersionBlock firstVersion="0.21">

  ```bash
  # tests on all sources
  $ dbt test --select source:*

  # tests on one source
  $ dbt test --select source:jaffle_shop

  # tests on one source table
  $ dbt test --select source:jaffle_shop.customers

  # tests on everything _except_ sources
  $ dbt test --exclude source:*
  ```

</VersionBlock>
<VersionBlock lastVersion="0.20">

  ```bash
  # tests on all sources
  $ dbt test --models source:*

  # tests on one source
  $ dbt test --models source:jaffle_shop

  # tests on one source table
  $ dbt test --models source:jaffle_shop.customers

  # tests on everything _except_ sources
  $ dbt test --exclude source:*
  ```

</VersionBlock>

 ### More complex selection

Through the combination of direct and indirect selection, there are many ways to accomplish the same outcome. Let's say we have a data test named `assert_total_payment_amount_is_positive` that depends on a model named `payments`. All of the following would manage to select and execute that test specifically:

<VersionBlock firstVersion="0.21">

  ```bash
  $ dbt test --select assert_total_payment_amount_is_positive # directly select the test by name
  $ dbt test --select payments,test_type:singular # indirect selection, v1.2
  $ dbt test --select payments,test_type:data # indirect selection, v0.18.0
  $ dbt test --select payments --data  # indirect selection, earlier versions
  ```

</VersionBlock>
<VersionBlock lastVersion="0.20">

  ```bash
  $ dbt test --models assert_total_payment_amount_is_positive # directly select the test by name
  $ dbt test --models payments,test_type:data # indirect selection, v0.18.0
  $ dbt test --models payments --data  # indirect selection, earlier versions
  ```

</VersionBlock>

 As long as you can select a common property of a group of resources, indirect selection allows you to execute all the tests on those resources, too. In the example above, we saw it was possible to test all table-materialized models. This principle can be extended to other resource types, too:

<VersionBlock firstVersion="0.21">

  ```bash
  # Run tests on all models with a particular materialization
  $ dbt test --select config.materialized:table

  # Run tests on all seeds, which use the 'seed' materialization
  $ dbt test --select config.materialized:seed

  # Run tests on all snapshots, which use the 'snapshot' materialization
  $ dbt test --select config.materialized:snapshot
  ```

</VersionBlock>
<VersionBlock lastVersion="0.20">

  ```bash
  # Run tests on all models with a particular materialization
  $ dbt test --models config.materialized:table

  # Run tests on all seeds, which use the 'seed' materialization
  $ dbt test --models config.materialized:seed

  # Run tests on all snapshots, which use the 'snapshot' materialization
  $ dbt test --models config.materialized:snapshot
  ```

</VersionBlock>

 Note that this functionality may change in future versions of dbt.

### Run tests on tagged columns

Because the column `order_id` is tagged `my_column_tag`, the test itself also receives the tag `my_column_tag`. Because of that, this is an example of direct selection.

<File name='models/<filename>.yml'>

```yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: orders
    columns:
      - name: order_id
        tests:
        tags: [my_column_tag]
          - unique

```

</File>

<VersionBlock firstVersion="0.21">

  ```bash
  $ dbt test --select tag:my_column_tag
  ```

</VersionBlock>
<VersionBlock lastVersion="0.20">

  ```bash
  $ dbt test --models tag:my_column_tag
  ```

</VersionBlock>

Currently, tests "inherit" tags applied to columns, sources, and source tables. They do _not_ inherit tags applied to models, seeds, or snapshots. In all likelihood, those tests would still be selected indirectly, because the tag selects its parent. This is a subtle distinction, and it may change in future versions of dbt.

### Run tagged tests only

This is an even clearer example of direct selection: the test itself is tagged `my_test_tag`, and selected accordingly.

<File name='models/<filename>.yml'>

```yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: orders
    columns:
      - name: order_id
        tests:
          - unique:
              tags: [my_test_tag]

```

</File>

<VersionBlock firstVersion="0.21">

  ```bash
  $ dbt test --select tag:my_test_tag
  ```

</VersionBlock>
<VersionBlock lastVersion="0.20">

  ```bash
  $ dbt test --models tag:my_test_tag
  ```

</VersionBlock>
