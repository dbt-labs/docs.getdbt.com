```bash
$ dbt run --models my_package.*+      # select all models in my_package and their children
$ dbt run --models +some_model+       # select some_model and all parents and children

$ dbt run --models tag:nightly+       # select "nightly" models and all children
$ dbt run --models +tag:nightly+      # select "nightly" models and all parents and children

$ dbt run --models @source:snowplow   # build all models that select from snowplow sources, plus their parents

$ dbt test --models config.incremental_strategy:insert_overwrite,test_name:unique   # execute all `unique` tests that select from models using the `insert_overwrite` incremental strategy
```

This can get complex! Let's say I want a nightly run of models that build off snowplow data
and feed exports, while _excluding_ the biggest incremental models (and one other model, to boot).

```bash
$ dbt run --models @source:snowplow,tag:nightly models/export --exclude package:snowplow,config.materialized:incremental export_performance_timing
```

This command selects all models that:
* Select from snowplow sources, plus their parents, _and_ are tagged "nightly"
* Are defined in the `export` model subfolder

Except for models that are:
* Defined in the snowplow package and materialized incrementally
* Named `export_performance_timing`
