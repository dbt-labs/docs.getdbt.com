### Unions
Providing multiple space-delineated arguments to the `--select`, `--exclude`, or `--selector` flags selects
the union of them all. If a resource is included in at least one selector, it will be
included in the final set.

Run snowplow_sessions, all ancestors of snowplow_sessions, fct_orders, and all ancestors of fct_orders:


  ```bash
  $ dbt run --select +snowplow_sessions +fct_orders
  ```

### Intersections

If multiple arguments to `--select`, `--exclude`, and `--selector` can be comma-separated (with no whitespace in between),
dbt will select only resources which satisfy _all_ arguments.

Run all the common ancestors of snowplow_sessions and fct_orders:


  ```bash
  $ dbt run --select +snowplow_sessions,+fct_orders
  ```


Run all the common descendents of stg_invoices and stg_accounts:


  ```bash
  $ dbt run --select stg_invoices+,stg_accounts+
  ```


Run models that are in the marts/finance subdirectory *and* tagged nightly:


  ```bash
  $ dbt run --select marts.finance,tag:nightly
  ```
