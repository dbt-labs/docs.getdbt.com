title: "dbt Command reference"
---

dbt is typically run one of two ways:
* In [dbt Cloud](/docs/cloud/develop-in-the-cloud)
* On the [command line interface](/docs/core/about-the-cli) (CLI)

The following sections outline the commands supported by dbt and their relevant flags. Note that some commands are only supported when using the CLI. 

For information about selecting models on the command line, consult the docs on [Model selection syntax](node-selection/syntax).

### Available commands

Select the tabs that are relevant to the your development workflow. For example, if you develop in the dbt Cloud IDE, select **dbt Cloud**. 

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cloud" label="dbt Cloud">

Use the following dbt commands in the [dbt Cloud IDE](/docs/cloud/develop-in-the-cloud) and use the `dbt` prefix. For example, to run the `test` command, type `dbt test`.

- [build](/reference/commands/build): build and test all selected resources (models, seeds, snapshots, tests)
- [compile](/reference/commands/compile): compiles (but does not run) the models in a project
- [deps](/reference/commands/deps): downloads dependencies for a project
- [docs](/reference/commands/cmd-docs) : generates documentation for a project
- [run](/reference/commands/run): runs the models in a project
- [run-operation](/reference/commands/run-operation): invoke a macro, including running arbitrary maintenance SQL against the database
- [seed](/reference/commands/seed): loads CSV files into the database
- [show](/reference/commands/show): preview table rows post-transformation
- [snapshot](/reference/commands/snapshot): executes "snapshot" jobs defined in a project
- [source](/reference/commands/source): provides tools for working with source data (including validating that sources are "fresh")
- [test](/reference/commands/test): executes tests defined in a project
