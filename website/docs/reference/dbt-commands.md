title: "dbt Command reference"
---

dbt is typically run one of two ways:
* In [dbt Cloud](/docs/cloud/develop-in-the-cloud)
* On the [command line interface](/docs/core/about-the-cli) (CLI)

The following sections outline the commands supported by dbt and their relevant flags. Note that some commands are only supported when using the CLI. Select the tabs that are relevant to the your development workflow. For example, if you develop in the dbt Cloud IDE, select the "Available commands in dbt Cloud" tab. 

For information about selecting models on the command line, consult the docs on [Model selection syntax](node-selection/syntax).


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cloud" label="Available commands in dbt Cloud">

- [compile](/reference/commands/compile): compiles (but does not run) the models in a project
- [deps](/reference/commands/deps): downloads dependencies for a project
- [docs](/reference/commands/cmd-docs) : generates documentation for a project

- [show](/reference/commands/show): preview table rows post-transformation
- [snapshot](/reference/commands/snapshot): executes "snapshot" jobs defined in a project
