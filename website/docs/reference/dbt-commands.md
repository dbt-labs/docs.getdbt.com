dbt is typically run one of two ways:

* In [dbt Cloud](/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud)
* On the [command line interface](/docs/core/about-the-cli) (CLI)

The following sections outline the commands supported by dbt and their relevant flags. For information about selecting models on the command line, consult the docs on [Model selection syntax](/reference/node-selection/syntax).
