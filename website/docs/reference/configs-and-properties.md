title: Configs, properties, what are they?
---

Resources in your project—models, snapshots, seeds, tests, and the rest—can have a number of declared **properties**. Resources can also define **configurations**, which are a special kind of property that bring extra abilities. What's the distinction?
- Properties are declared for resources one-by-one in  `properties.yml` files. Configs can be defined there, nested under a `config` property. They can also be set one-by-one via a `config()` macro (right within `.sql` files), and for many resources at once in `dbt_project.yml`.
- Because configs can be set in multiple places, they are also applied hierarchically. An individual resource might _inherit_ or _override_ configs set elsewhere.
- You can select resources based on their config values using the `config:` selection method, but not the values of non-config properties.
- There are slightly different naming conventions for properties and configs depending on the file type. Refer to [naming convention](/reference/dbt_project.yml#naming-convention) for more details.

A rule of thumb: properties declare things _about_ your project resources; configs go the extra step of telling dbt _how_ to build those resources in your warehouse. This is generally true, but not always, so it's always good to check!

For example, you can use resource **properties** to:
* Describe models, snapshots, seed files, and their columns
* Assert "truths" about a model, in the form of [data tests](/docs/build/data-tests), e.g. "this `id` column is unique"
* Define pointers to existing tables that contain raw data, in the form of [sources](/docs/build/sources), and assert the expected "freshness" of this raw data
* Define official downstream uses of your data models, in the form of [exposures](/docs/build/exposures)

Whereas you can use **configurations** to:
* Change how a model will be materialized (<Term id="table" />, <Term id="view" />, incremental, etc)
* Declare where a seed will be created in the database (`<database>.<schema>.<alias>`)
* Declare whether a resource should persist its descriptions as comments in the database
* Apply tags and "meta" properties

## Where can I define configs?

Depending on the resource type, configurations can be defined in the dbt project and also in an installed package by:

<VersionBlock firstVersion="1.9">

1. Using a [`config` property](/reference/resource-properties/config) in a `.yml` file in the `models/`, `snapshots/`, `seeds/`, `analyses`, or `tests/` directory
2. From the [`dbt_project.yml` file](dbt_project.yml), under the corresponding resource key (`models:`, `snapshots:`, `tests:`, etc)
</VersionBlock>

<VersionBlock lastVersion="1.8">

1. Using a [`config()` Jinja macro](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/config) within a `model`, `snapshot`, or `test` SQL file
2. Using a [`config` property](/reference/resource-properties/config) in a `.yml` file in the `models/`, `snapshots/`, `seeds/`, `analyses/`, or `tests/` directory.
3. From the [`dbt_project.yml` file](dbt_project.yml), under the corresponding resource key (`models:`, `snapshots:`, `tests:`, etc)
</VersionBlock>

### Config inheritance

The most specific config always takes precedence. This generally follows the order above: an in-file `config()` block --> properties defined in a `.yml` file --> config defined in the project file. 

Note - Generic data tests work a little differently when it comes to specificity. See [test configs](/reference/data-test-configs).

Within the project file, configurations are also applied hierarchically. The most specific config always takes precedence. In the project file, for example, configurations applied to a `marketing` subdirectory will take precedence over configurations applied to the entire `jaffle_shop` project. To apply a configuration to a model or directory of models, define the [resource path](/reference/resource-configs/resource-path) as nested dictionary keys.

Configurations in your root dbt project have _higher_ precedence than configurations in installed packages. This enables you to override the configurations of installed packages, providing more control over your dbt runs. 


### Combining configs

Most configurations are "clobbered" when applied hierarchically. Whenever a more specific value is available, it will completely replace the less specific value. Note that a few configs have different merge behavior:
- [`tags`](/tags) are additive. If a model has some tags configured in `dbt_project.yml`, and more tags applied in its `.sql` file, the final set of tags will include all of them.
- [`meta`](/reference/resource-configs/meta) dictionaries are merged (a more specific key-value pair replaces a less specific value with the same key)
- [`pre-hook` and `post-hook`](/reference/resource-configs/pre-hook-post-hook) are also additive.

## Where can I define properties?

In dbt, you can use `properties.yml` files to define properties for resources. You can declare properties in `.yml` files, in the same directory as your resources. You can name these files `whatever_you_want.yml` and nest them arbitrarily in sub-folders within each directory. 

We highly recommend that you define properties in dedicated paths alongside the resources they're describing.

#### schema.yml files

Previous versions of the docs referred to these as `schema.yml` files — we've moved away from that terminology since the word `schema` is used to mean other things when talking about databases, and people often thought that you _had_ to name these files `schema.yml`.

Instead, we now refer to these files as `properties.yml` files. (Of course, you're still free to name your files `schema.yml`)

:::

### Which properties are _not_ also configs?

In dbt, you can define node configs in `properties.yml` files, in addition to `config()` blocks and `dbt_project.yml`. However, some special properties can only be defined in the `.yml` file and you cannot configure them using `config()` blocks or the `dbt_project.yml` file:

Certain properties are special, because:

- They have a unique Jinja rendering context
- They create new project resources
- They don't make sense as hierarchical configuration
- They're older properties that haven't yet been redefined as configs

These properties are:

- [`description`](/reference/resource-properties/description)
- [`tests`](/reference/resource-properties/data-tests)
- [`docs`](/reference/resource-configs/docs)
- [`columns`](/reference/resource-properties/columns)
- [`quote`](/reference/resource-properties/quote)
- [`source` properties](/reference/source-properties) (e.g. `loaded_at_field`, `freshness`)
- [`exposure` properties](/reference/exposure-properties) (e.g. `type`, `maturity`)
- [`macro` properties](/reference/macro-properties) (e.g. `arguments`)

## Example
Here's an example that defines both `sources` and `models` for a project:

<File name='models/jaffle_shop.yml'>

```yml
version: 2

sources:
  - name: raw_jaffle_shop
    description: A replica of the postgres database used to power the jaffle_shop app.
    tables:
      - name: customers
        columns:
          - name: id
            description: Primary key of the table
            tests:
              - unique
              - not_null

      - name: orders
        columns:
          - name: id
            description: Primary key of the table
            tests:
              - unique
              - not_null

          - name: user_id
            description: Foreign key to customers

          - name: status
            tests:
              - accepted_values:
                  values: ['placed', 'shipped', 'completed', 'return_pending', 'returned']


models:
  - name: stg_jaffle_shop__customers
    config:
      tags: ['pii']
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null

  - name: stg_jaffle_shop__orders
    config:
      materialized: view
    columns:
      - name: order_id
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      - name: status
        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values: ['placed', 'shipped', 'completed', 'return_pending', 'returned']
              config:
                severity: warn

## Troubleshooting common errors

### Invalid test config given in [model name]

This error occurs when your `.yml` file does not conform to the structure expected by dbt. A full error message might look like:
```
* Invalid test config given in models/schema.yml near {'namee': 'event', ...}
  Invalid arguments passed to "UnparsedNodeUpdate" instance: 'name' is a required property, Additional properties are not allowed ('namee' was unexpected)
```

While verbose, an error like this should help you track down the issue. Here, the `name` field was provided as `namee` by accident. To fix this error, ensure that your `.yml` conforms to the expected structure described in this guide.

### Invalid syntax in your schema.yml file

If your `.yml` file is not valid yaml, then dbt will show you an error like this:

```
Runtime Error
  Syntax error near line 6
  ------------------------------
  5  |   - name: events
  6  |     description; "A table containing clickstream events from the marketing website"
  7  |

  Raw Error:
  ------------------------------
  while scanning a simple key
    in "<unicode string>", line 6, column 5:
          description; "A table containing clickstream events from the marketing website"
          ^

```

This error occurred because a semicolon (`;`) was accidentally used instead of a colon (`:`) after the `description` field. To resolve issues like this, find the `.yml` file referenced in the error message and fix any syntax errors present in the file. There are online YAML validators that can be helpful here, but please be mindful of submitting sensitive information to third-party applications!
