<Changelog>

- **v1.0.0:** The default config name for `data-paths` is now [`seed-paths`](seed-paths), `source-paths` is now [`model-paths`](model-paths) and `modules-path` is now [`packages-install-path`](packages-install-path).

Every [dbt project](projects) needs a `dbt_project.yml` file â€” this is how dbt knows a directory is a dbt project. It also contains important information that tells dbt how to operate on your project.

The following is a list of all available configurations in the `dbt_project.yml` file.

:::info YAML syntax
dbt uses YAML in a few different places. If you're new to YAML, it would be worth taking the time to learn how arrays, dictionaries and strings are represented.
