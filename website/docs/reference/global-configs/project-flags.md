flags:

Reference the [table of all flags](/reference/global-configs/about-global-configs#available-flags) to see which global configs are available for setting in [`dbt_project.yml`](/reference/dbt_project.yml).

The `flags` dictionary is the _only_ place you can opt out of [behavior changes](/reference/global-configs/legacy-behaviors), while the legacy behavior is still supported.

:::warning Deprecated functionality
In older versions of dbt, custom default values of flags (global configs) were set in `profiles.yml`. Starting in v1.8, these configs are set in `dbt_project.yml` instead.
:::

For most global configurations, you can set "user profile" configurations in the `config:` block of `profiles.yml`. This style of configuration sets default values for all projects using this profile directory &mdash; usually, all projects running on your local machine.

<File name='profiles.yml'>

```yaml

config:
  <THIS-CONFIG>: true

```

</File>

The exception: Some global configurations are actually set in `dbt_project.yml`, instead of `profiles.yml`, because they control where dbt places logs and artifacts. Those file paths are always relative to the location of `dbt_project.yml`. For more details, refer to [Log and target paths](/reference/global-configs/logs#log-and-target-paths).
