Supply the `-x` or `--fail-fast` flag to `dbt run` to make dbt exit immediately if a single resource fails to build. If other models are in-progress when the first model fails, then dbt will terminate the connections for these still-running models.

For example, you can select four models to run, but if a failure occurs in the first model, the failure will prevent other models from running:

```text
dbt -x run --threads 1
Running with dbt=1.0.0
Found 4 models, 1 test, 1 snapshot, 2 analyses, 143 macros, 0 operations, 1 seed file, 0 sources
