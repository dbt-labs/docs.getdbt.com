Use the `--indirect_selection` flag to `dbt test` or `dbt build` to configure which tests to run for the nodes you specify. You can set this as a CLI flag or an environment variable. In dbt Core, you can also configure user configurations in [YAML selectors](/reference/node-selection/yaml-selectors) or in the `flags:` block of `dbt_project.yml`, which sets project-level flags.

When all flags are set, the order of precedence is as follows. Refer to [About global configs](/reference/global-configs/about-global-configs) for more details:

1. CLI configurations
1. Environment variables
1. User configurations

You can set the flag to: `empty`, `buildable`, `cautious`, or `eager` (default). By default, dbt indirectly selects all tests if they touch any resource you select. Learn more about these options in [Indirect selection in Test selection examples](/reference/node-selection/test-selection-examples?indirect-selection-mode=eager#indirect-selection).

The following is a visualization of the impact `--indirect-selection` and the various flags have using three models, three tests, and `dbt build` as an example:

For example, you can run tests that only refer to selected nodes using a CLI configuration:

<File name='Usage'>

```shell
dbt test --indirect-selection cautious
```

</File>

Or you can run tests that only refer to selected nodes using an environment variable:

<File name='Env var'>

```text

$ export DBT_INDIRECT_SELECTION=cautious
dbt run

```

</File>

You can also run tests that only refer to selected nodes using `dbt_project.yml` project-level flags:

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yaml

flags:
  indirect_selection: cautious

```

</File>
