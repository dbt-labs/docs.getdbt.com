<Changelog>

- **v1.0.0:** The `modules-path` has been updated to be [`packages-install-path`](/reference/project-configs/packages-install-path).  The default value has also been updated to be `dbt-packages` from `dbt-modules`.

</Changelog>

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yml
clean-targets: [directorypath]
```

</File>


## Definition
Optionally specify a custom list of directories to be removed by the `dbt clean` [command](/reference/commands/clean). As such, you should only include directories containing artifacts (e.g. compiled files, logs, installed packages) in this list.

## Default
If this configuration is not included in your `dbt_project.yml` file, the `clean` command will remove files in your [target-path](/reference/project-configs/target-path).

## Examples
### Remove packages and compiled files as part of `dbt clean`
:::info
This is our preferred configuration, but is not the default.
:::
To remove packages as well as compiled files, include the value of your [packages-install-path](/reference/project-configs/packages-install-path) configuration in your `clean-targets` configuration.

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yml
clean-targets:
    - target
    - dbt_packages
```

</File>

Now, run `dbt clean`.

Both the `target` and `dbt_packages` directory will be removed.

Note: this is the configuration in the dbt [starter project](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-starter-project/blob/HEAD/dbt_project.yml), which is generated by the `init` command.


### Remove `logs` when running `dbt clean`

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yml
clean-targets: [target, dbt_packages, logs]

```

</File>
