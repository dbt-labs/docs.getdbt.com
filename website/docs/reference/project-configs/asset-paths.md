## Definition
Optionally specify a custom list of directories to copy to the `target` directory as part of the `docs generate` command. This is useful for rendering images in your repository in your project documentation.

<Changelog>

* `v0.18.0`: This configuration was introduced â€” see the [migration guide for 0.18.0](upgrading-to-0-18-0) for more details.

</Changelog>

## Default
By default, dbt will not compile any additional files as part of `docs generate`, i.e. `analysis-paths: []`

## Examples
### Compile files in the `assets` subdirectory as part of `docs generate`

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yml
asset-paths: ["assets"]
```

</File>

Any files included in this directory will be copied to the `target/` directory as part of `dbt docs generate`, making them accessible as images in your project documentation.
