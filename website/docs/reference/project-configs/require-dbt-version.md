## Definition

You can use `require-dbt-version` to restrict your project to only work with a range of dbt versions. 

When you set this configuration, dbt sends a helpful error message for any user who attempts to run the project with an unsupported version of dbt. This can be useful for package maintainers (such as [dbt-utils](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils)) to ensure that users' dbt version is compatible with the package. Setting this configuration might also help your whole team remain synchronized on the same version of dbt for local development, to avoid compatibility issues from changed behaviour.

If this configuration is not specified, no version check will occur.

### YAML quoting

This configuration needs to be interpolated by the YAML parser as a string. As such, you should quote the value of the configuration, taking care to avoid whitespace. For example:
```yml
# ✅ These will work
require-dbt-version: ">=1.0.0" # Double quotes are OK
require-dbt-version: '>=1.0.0' # So are single quotes

# ❌ These will not work
require-dbt-version: >=1.0.0 # No quotes? No good
require-dbt-version: ">= 1.0.0" # Don't put whitespace after the equality signs
```


## Examples

### Specify a minimum dbt version
Use a `>=` operator for a minimum boundary. In the following example, this project will run with any version of dbt greater than or equal to 1.0.0.


<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yml
require-dbt-version: ">=1.0.0"
```

</File>


### Pin to a range
Use a comma separated list for an upper and lower bound. In the following example, this project will run with dbt 1.x.x.

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yml
require-dbt-version: [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]
```

</File>

OR

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yml
require-dbt-version: ">=1.0.0,<2.0.0"
```

</File>

  
### Require a specific dbt version

:::info Not recommended
Pinning to a specific dbt version is discouraged because it limits project flexibility and can cause compatibility issues, especially with dbt packages. It's recommended to [pin to a major release](#pin-to-a-range), using a version range (for example, `">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"`) for broader compatibility and to benefit from updates.

While you can restrict your project to run only with an exact version of dbt Core, we do not recommend this for dbt Core v1.0.0 and higher. 

:::

In the following example, the project will only run with dbt v1.5: 

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yml
require-dbt-version: "1.5.0"
```

</File>

## Invalid dbt versions

If the version of dbt used to invoke a project disagrees with the specified `require-dbt-version` in the project or _any_ of the included packages, then dbt will fail immediately with the following error:
```
$ dbt compile
Running with dbt=0.21.0
Encountered an error while reading the project:
Runtime Error
  This version of dbt is not supported with the 'my_project' package.
    Installed version of dbt: =0.21.0
    Required version of dbt for 'my_project': ['>=1.0.0', '<2.0.0']
  Check the requirements for the 'my_project' package, or run dbt again with --no-version-check
```

## Disabling version checks

To suppress failures to to incompatible dbt versions, supply the `--no-version-check` flag to `dbt run`.
```
$ dbt run --no-version-check
Running with dbt=0.21.0
Found 13 models, 2 tests, 1 archives, 0 analyses, 204 macros, 2 operations....
```

See [global configs](/reference/global-configs/version-compatibility) for usage details.

## Recommendation
* This is a recommended configuration
* Before v1, you should pin your required dbt version to a minor release. After v1, you should pin to a major release (see above [example](#pin-to-a-range))
