profile: string

## Definition
The profile your dbt project should use to connect to your <Term id="data-warehouse" />.
* If you are developing in dbt Cloud: This configuration is optional
* If you are developing locally: This configuration is required, unless a command-line option (i.e. `--profile`) is supplied.

## Recommendation
Often an organization has only one <Term id="data-warehouse" />, so it is sensible to use your organization's name as a profile name, in `snake_case`. For example:
* `profile: acme`
* `profile: jaffle_shop`

It is also reasonable to include the name of your warehouse technology in your profile name, particularly if you have multiple warehouses. For example:
* `profile: acme_snowflake`
* `profile: jaffle_shop_bigquery`
* `profile: jaffle_shop_redshift`
