dbt projects have two distinct types of `version` tags. This field has a different meaning depending on its location.

## `dbt_project.yml` versions

The version tag in a `dbt_project` file represents the version of your dbt project. 

Starting in dbt version 1.5, `version` in the `dbt_project.yml` is an *optional parameter*. If used, the version must be in a [semantic version](https://semver.org/) format, such as `1.0.0`. The default value is `None` if not specified. For users on dbt version 1.4 or lower, this tag is required, though it isn't currently used meaningfully by dbt.

For more on Core versions, see [About dbt Core versions](/docs/dbt-versions/core).

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yml
version: version
```

## `.yml` property file versions

A version tag in a `.yml` property file provides the control tag, which informs how dbt processes property files. 

Starting from version 1.5, dbt will no longer require this configuration in your resource `.yml` files.  If you want to know more about why this tag was previously required, you can refer to the [FAQs](#faqs). For users on dbt version 1.4 or lower, this tag is required,

For more on property files, see their general [documentation](/reference/configs-and-properties#where-can-i-define-properties) on the same page.
