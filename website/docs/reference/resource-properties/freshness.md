## Definition
A freshness block is used to define the acceptable amount of time between the most recent record, and now, for a <Term id="table" /> to be considered "fresh".

In the `freshness` block, one or both of `warn_after` and `error_after` can be provided. If neither is provided, then dbt will not calculate freshness snapshots for the tables in this source.

Additionally, the `loaded_at_field` is required to calculate freshness for a table. If a `loaded_at_field` is not provided, then dbt will not calculate freshness for the table.

Freshness blocks are applied hierarchically:
- a `freshness` and `loaded_at_field` property added to a source will be applied to all all tables defined in that source
- a `freshness` and `loaded_at_field` property added to a source _table_ will override any properties applied to the source.

This is useful when all of the tables in a source have the same `loaded_at_field`, as is often the case.

## loaded_at_field
(Required)

A column name (or expression) that returns a timestamp indicating freshness.

If using a date field, you may have to cast it to a timestamp:
```yml
loaded_at_field: "completed_date::timestamp"
```

Or, depending on your SQL variant:
```yml
loaded_at_field: "CAST(completed_date AS TIMESTAMP)"
```

If using a non-UTC timestamp, cast it to UTC first:

```yml
loaded_at_field: "convert_timezone('UTC', 'Australia/Sydney', created_at_local)"
```

## count
(Required)

A positive integer for the number of periods where a data source is still considered "fresh".

## period
(Required)

The time period used in the freshness calculation. One of `minute`, `hour` or `day`

## filter
(optional)

Add a where clause to the query run by `dbt source freshness` in order to limit data scanned.

This filter *only* applies to dbt's source freshness queries - it will not impact other uses of the source table.

This is particularly useful if:
- You are using BigQuery and your source tables are [partitioned tables](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables)
- You are using Snowflake, Databricks or Spark with large tables, and this results in a performance benefit


## Examples

### Complete example
<File name='models/<filename>.yml'>

```yaml

version: 2

sources:
  - name: jaffle_shop
    database: raw

    freshness: # default freshness
      warn_after: {count: 12, period: hour}
      error_after: {count: 24, period: hour}

    loaded_at_field: _etl_loaded_at

    tables:
      - name: customers # this will use the freshness defined above

      - name: orders
        freshness: # make this a little more strict
          warn_after: {count: 6, period: hour}
          error_after: {count: 12, period: hour}
          # Apply a where clause in the freshness query
          filter: datediff('day', _etl_loaded_at, current_timestamp) < 2


      - name: product_skus
        freshness: # do not check freshness for this table
```

</File>

When running `dbt source freshness`, the following query will be run:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="compiled"
  values={[
    { label: 'Compiled SQL', value: 'compiled', },
    { label: 'Jinja SQL', value: 'jinja', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="compiled">

```sql
select
  max(_etl_loaded_at) as max_loaded_at,
  convert_timezone('UTC', current_timestamp()) as snapshotted_at
from raw.jaffle_shop.orders

where datediff('day', _etl_loaded_at, current_timestamp) < 2

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="jinja">

```sql
select
  max({{ loaded_at_field }}) as max_loaded_at,
  {{ current_timestamp() }} as snapshotted_at
from {{ source }}
{% if filter %}
where {{ filter }}
{% endif %}
```
