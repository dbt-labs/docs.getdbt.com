This functionality is new in v1.5! These docs exist to provide a high-level overview of what's to come. Specific syntax is liable to change.

* ["Unify constraints and constraints_check configs" (dbt-core#6750)](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/6750)
:::

In transactional databases, it is possible to define "constraints" on the allowed values of certain columns, stricter than just the data type of those values. Because Postgres is a transactional database, it supports and enforces all the constraints in the ANSI SQL standard (`not null`, `unique`, `primary key`, `foreign key`), plus a flexible row-level `check` constraint that evaluates to a boolean expression.

Most analytical data platforms support and enforce a `not null` constraint, but they either do not support or do not enforce the rest. It is sometimes still desirable to add an "informational" constraint, knowing it is _not_ enforced, for the purpose of integrating with legacy data catalog or entity-relation diagram tools ([dbt-core#3295](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/3295)).

<div warehouse="Snowflake">

- Snowflake constraints documentation: [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/constraints-overview.html)
- Snowflake data types: [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/intro-summary-data-types.html)

Snowflake suppports four types of constraints: `unique`, `not null`, `primary key` and `foreign key`.

It is important to note that only the `not null` (and the `not null` property of `primary key`) are actually checked today.
There rest of the constraints are purely metadata, not verified when inserting data.

Currently, Snowflake doesn't support the `check` syntax and dbt will skip the `check` config and raise a warning message if it is set on some models in the dbt project.

<div warehouse="Databricks">

Databricks allows you to define:

- a `not null` constraint
- and/or additional `check` constraints, with conditional expressions including one or more columns

As Databricks does not support transactions nor allows using `create or replace table` with a column schema, the table is first created without a schema and `alter` statements are then executed to add the different constraints. 

This means that:

- The names and order of columns is checked but not their type
- If the `constraints` and/or `constraint_check` fails, the table with the failing data will still exist in the Warehouse

See [this page](https://docs.databricks.com/tables/constraints.html) with more details about the support of constraints on Databricks.
