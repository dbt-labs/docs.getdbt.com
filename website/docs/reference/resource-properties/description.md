## Definition
A user-defined description. Can be used to document:
- a model, and model columns
- sources, source tables, and source columns
- seeds, and seed columns
- snapshots, and snapshot columns
- analyses, and analysis columns
- macros, and macro arguments

These descriptions are used in the documentation website rendered by dbt (see [the documentation guide](documentation)).

Descriptions can include markdown, as well as the [`doc` jinja function](doc).

:::caution You may need to quote your YAML

Be mindful of YAML semantics when providing a description. If your description contains special yaml characters like curly brackets, colons, or square brackets, you may need to quote your description. An example of a quoted description is shown [below](#use-some-markdown-in-a-description).

:::

## Examples

### Add a simple description to a model and column

<File name='models/schema.yml'>

```yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: dim_customers
    description: One record per customer

    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        description: Primary key

```

</File>

### Add a multiline description to a model

You can use YAML [block notation](https://yaml-multiline.info/) to split a longer description over multiple lines:

<File name='models/schema.yml'>

```yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: dim_customers
    description: >
      One record per customer. Note that a customer must have made a purchase to
      be included in this table — customer accounts that were created but never
      used have been filtered out.

    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        description: Primary key.

```

</File>

### Use some markdown in a description

You can use markdown in your descriptions, but you may need to quote your description to ensure the YAML parser doesn't get confused by special characters!

<File name='models/schema.yml'>

```yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: dim_customers
    description: "**\[Read more](https://www.google.com/)**"

    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        description: Primary key.

```

</File>

### Use a docs block in a description

If you have a long description, especially if it contains markdown, it may make more sense to leverage a [`docs` block](doc). A benefit of this approach is that code editors will correctly highlight markdown, making it easier to debug as you write.

<File name='models/schema.yml'>

```yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: fct_orders
    description: This table has basic information about orders, as well as some derived facts based on payments

    columns:
      - name: status
        description: '{{ doc("orders_status") }}'

```

</File>

<File name='models/docs.md'>

```

{% docs orders_status %}

Orders can be one of the following statuses:

| status         | description                                                               |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| placed         | The order has been placed but has not yet left the warehouse              |
| shipped        | The order has ben shipped to the customer and is currently in transit     |
| completed      | The order has been received by the customer                               |
| returned       | The order has been returned by the customer and received at the warehouse |


{% enddocs %}

```

</File>


### Link to another model in a description

You can use relative links to link to another model. It's a little hacky — but to do this:

1. Serve your docs site.
2. Navigate to the model you want to link to, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8080/#!/model/model.jaffle_shop.stg_stripe__payments`
3. Copy the url_path, i.e. everything after `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`, so in this case `!/model/model.jaffle_shop.stg_stripe__payments`
4. Paste it as the link

<File name='models/schema.yml'>

```yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: customers
    description: "Filtering done based on \[stg_stripe__payments](#!/model/model.jaffle_shop.stg_stripe__payments)"

    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        description: Primary key

```

</File>


### Include an image from your repo in your descriptions
To include an image from your repository in your descriptions:
1. Add the file in a subdirectory, e.g. `assets/dbt-logo.png`
2. Set the [`asset-paths` config](project-configs/asset-paths) in your `dbt_project.yml` file so that this directory gets copied to the `target/` directory as part of `dbt docs generate`

<File name='dbt_project.yml'>

```yml
asset-paths: ["assets"]
```

</File>

2. Use a Markdown link to the image in your `description:`

<File name='models/schema.yml'>

```yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: customers
    description: "!\[dbt Logo](assets/dbt-logo.png)"

    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        description: Primary key

```

</File>

_[CLI users only]_

3. Run `dbt docs generate` — the `assets` directory will be copied to the `target` directory

4. Run `dbt docs serve` — the image will be rendered as part of your project documentation:

<Lightbox src="/img/reference/image-in-docs.png" title="The image at assets/dbt-logo.png is rendered correctly"/>

If mixing images and text together, also consider using a docs block.

### Include an image from the web in your descriptions

Use the image URL to render the image.

<File name='models/schema.yml'>

```yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: customers
    description: "!\[dbt Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/dev/marian-anderson/etc/dbt-logo-full.svg)"

    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        description: Primary key

```

</File>

If mixing images and text together, also consider using a docs block.



### Use html in a description

You can use html in the description to do fancier things than you can in just markdown. Embedding iframes work too! It is recomended you do this in a docs block for ease of maintenance. 


<File name='models/docs.md'>

```

{% docs orders_status %}

Here is an image documenting the ERD for this table:

<div style="width: 640px; height: 480px; margin: 10px; position: relative;"><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder="0" style="width:640px; height:480px" src="https://your-embed-url.com"></iframe></div>

{% enddocs %}

```
