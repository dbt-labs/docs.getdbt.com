title: Snapshot properties
description: "Read this guide to learn about using source properties in dbt."

Snapshots properties can be declared in `.yml` files in:
- your `snapshots/` directory (as defined by the [`snapshot-paths` config](/reference/project-configs/snapshot-paths))
- your `models/` directory (as defined by the [`model-paths` config](/reference/project-configs/model-paths))

We recommend that you put them in the `snapshots/` directory. You can name these files `whatever_you_want.yml`, and nest them arbitrarily deeply in subfolders within the `snapshots/` or `models/` directory.

<File name='snapshots/<filename>.yml'>
