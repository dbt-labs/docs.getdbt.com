title: "Programmatic invocations"
---

In v1.5, dbt-core added support for programmatic invocations. The intent is to expose the existing dbt CLI via a Python entry point, such that top-level commands are callable from within a Python script or application.

The entry point is a `dbtRunner` class, which allows you to `invoke` the same commands as on the CLI.

```python
from dbt.cli.main import dbtRunner, dbtRunnerResult

# initialize
dbt = dbtRunner()

# create CLI args as a list of strings
cli_args = ["run", "--select", "tag:my_tag"]

# run the command
res: dbtRunnerResult = dbt.invoke(cli_args)

# inspect the results
for r in res.result:
    print(f"{r.node.name}: {r.status}")
```

## `dbtRunnerResult`

Each command returns a `dbtRunnerResult` object, which has three attributes:
- `success` (bool): Whether the command succeeded.
- `result`: If the command completed (successfully or with handled errors), its result(s). Return type varies by command.
- `exception`: If the dbt invocation encountered an unhandled error and did not complete, the exception it encountered.

There is a 1:1 correspondence between [CLI exit codes](reference/exit-codes) and the `dbtRunnerResult` returned by a programmatic invocation:

| Scenario                                                                                    | CLI Exit Code | `success` | `result`         | `exception` |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------:|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Invocation completed without error                                                          | 0             | `True`      | varies by command | `None`        |
| Invocation completed with at least one handled error (e.g. test failure, model build error) | 1             | `False`     | varies by command | `None`        |
| Unhandled error. Invocation did not complete, and returns no results.                       | 2             | `False`     | `None`              | Exception   |

## Commitments & Caveats

From dbt Core v1.5 onward, we making an ongoing commitment to providing a Python entry point at functional parity with dbt-core's CLI. We reserve the right to change the underlying implementation used to achieve that goal. We expect that the current implementation will unlock real use cases, in the short & medium term, while we work on a set of stable, long-term interfaces that will ultimately replace it.

In particular, the objects returned by each command in `dbtRunnerResult.result` are not fully contracted, and therefore liable to change. Some of the returned objects are partially documented, because they overlap in part with the contents of [dbt artifacts](dbt-artifacts). As Python objects, they contain many more fields and methods than what's available in the serialized JSON artifacts. These additional fields and methods should be considered **internal and liable to change in future versions of dbt-core.**

## Advanced usage patterns

The syntax and support for these patterns are liable to change in future versions of `dbt-core`.

The goal of `dbtRunner` is to offer parity with CLI workflows, within a programmatic environment. There are a few advanced usage patterns that extend what's possible with the CLI.

### Reusing objects

Pass pre-constructed objects into `dbtRunner`, to avoid recreating those objects by reading files from disk. Currently, the only object supported is the `Manifest` (project contents).

```python
from dbt.cli.main import dbtRunner, dbtRunnerResult
from dbt.contracts.graph.manifest import Manifest

# use 'parse' command to load a Manifest
res: dbtRunnerResult = dbtRunner().invoke(["parse"])
manifest: Manifest = res.result

# introspect manifest
# e.g. assert every public model has a description
for node in manifest.nodes.values():
    if node.resource_type == "model" and node.access == "public":
        assert node.description != ""

# reuse this manifest in subsequent commands to skip parsing
dbt = dbtRunner(manifest=manifest)
cli_args = ["run", "--select", "tag:my_tag"]
res = dbt.invoke(cli_args)
```

### Registering callbacks

Register `callbacks` on dbt's `EventManager`, to access structured events and enable custom logging. The current behavior of callbacks is to block subsequent steps from proceeding; this functionality is not guaranteed in future versions.

```python
from dbt.cli.main import dbtRunner
from dbt.events.base_types import EventMsg

def print_version_callback(event: EventMsg):
    if event.info.name == "MainReportVersion":
        print(f"We are thrilled to be running dbt{event.data.version}")

dbt = dbtRunner(callbacks=[print_version_callback])
dbt.invoke(["list"])
```

### Overriding parameters

Pass in parameters as keyword arguments, instead of a list of CLI-style strings. At present, dbt will not do any validation or type coercion on your inputs. The subcommand must be specified, in a list, as the first positional argument.
```python
from dbt.cli.main import dbtRunner
dbt = dbtRunner()

# these are equivalent
dbt.invoke(["--fail-fast", "run", "--select", "tag:my_tag"])
dbt.invoke(["run"], select=["tag:my_tag"], fail_fast=True)
```
