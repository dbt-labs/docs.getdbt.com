<Changelog>

- Introduced in **v0.21.0**
    
</Changelog>

The `dbt build` command will:
- run models
- test tests
- snapshot snapshots
- seed seeds

In DAG order, for selected resources or an entire project.

### Details

**Artifacts:** The `build` task will write a single [manifest](artifacts/manifest-json) and a single [run results artifact](artifacts/run-results-json). The run results will include information about all models, tests, seeds, and snapshots that were selected to build, combined into one file.

**Skipping on failures:** Tests on upstream resources will block downstream resources from running, and a test failure will cause those downstream resources to skip entirely. E.g. If `model_b` depends on `model_a`, and a `unique` test on `model_a` fails, then `model_b` will `SKIP`.
- Don't want a test to cause skipping? Adjust its [severity or thresholds](severity) to `warn` instead of `error`
- In the case of a test with multiple parents, where one parent depends on the other (e.g. a `relationships` test between `model_a` + `model_b`), that test will block-and-skip children of the most-downstream parent only (`model_b`).

**Selecting resources:** The `build` task supports standard selection syntax (`--select`, `--exclude`, `--selector`), as well as a `--resource-type` flag that offers a final filter (just like `list`). Whichever resources are selected, those are the ones that `build` will run/test/snapshot/seed.
- Remember that tests support indirect selection, so `dbt build -s model_a` will both run _and_ test `model_a`. What does that mean? Any tests that directly depend on `model_a` will be included, so long as those tests don't also depend on other unselected parents. See [test selection](test-selection-examples) for details and examples.

**Flags:** The `build` task supports all the same flags as `run`, `test`, `snapshot`, and `seed`. For flags that are shared between multiple tasks (e.g. `--full-refresh`), `build` will use the same value for all selected resource types (e.g. both models and seeds will be full refreshed).
