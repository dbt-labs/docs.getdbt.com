`dbt retry` re-executes the last `dbt` command from the node point of failure. If the previously executed `dbt` command was successful, `retry` will finish as `no operation`. 

Retry works with the following commands:

- [`build`](/reference/commands/build)
- [`compile`](/reference/commands/compile)
- [`seed`](/reference/commands/seed)
- [`snapshot`](/reference/commands/build)
- [`test`](/reference/commands/test)
- [`run`](/reference/commands/run)
- [`run-operation`](/reference/commands/run-operation)

`dbt retry` references [run_results.json](/reference/artifacts/run-results-json) to determine where to start. Executing `dbt retry` without correcting the previous failures will garner <Term id="idempotent" /> results.

`dbt retry` reuses the [selectors](/reference/node-selection/yaml-selectors) from the previously executed command.


Example results of executing `dbt retry` after a successful `dbt run`:

```shell
Running with dbt=1.6.1
Registered adapter: duckdb=1.6.0
Found 5 models, 3 seeds, 20 tests, 0 sources, 0 exposures, 0 metrics, 348 macros, 0 groups, 0 semantic models
 
Nothing to do. Try checking your model configs and model specification args
```

Example of when `dbt run` encounters a syntax error in a model: 

```shell
Running with dbt=1.6.1
Registered adapter: duckdb=1.6.0
Found 5 models, 3 seeds, 20 tests, 0 sources, 0 exposures, 0 metrics, 348 macros, 0 groups, 0 semantic models

```


Example of a subsequent failed `dbt retry` run without fixing the error(s):

```shell
Running with dbt=1.6.1
Registered adapter: duckdb=1.6.0
Found 5 models, 3 seeds, 20 tests, 0 sources, 0 exposures, 0 metrics, 348 macros, 0 groups, 0 semantic models

Concurrency: 24 threads (target='dev')

1 of 1 START sql table model main.customers .................................... [RUN]
1 of 1 ERROR creating sql table model main.customers ........................... [ERROR in 0.03s]

Done. PASS=4 WARN=0 ERROR=1 SKIP=0 TOTAL=5
```

Example of a successful `dbt retry` run after fixing error(s):

```shell
Running with dbt=1.6.1
Registered adapter: duckdb=1.6.0
Found 5 models, 3 seeds, 20 tests, 0 sources, 0 exposures, 0 metrics, 348 macros, 0 groups, 0 semantic models
 
Concurrency: 24 threads (target='dev')

1 of 1 START sql table model main.customers .................................... [RUN]
1 of 1 OK created sql table model main.customers ............................... [OK in 0.05s]

Finished running 1 table model in 0 hours 0 minutes and 0.09 seconds (0.09s).
 
Completed successfully
  
Done. PASS=1 WARN=0 ERROR=0 SKIP=0 TOTAL=1
```

In each scenario `dbt retry` picks up from the error rather than running all of the upstream dependencies again.
