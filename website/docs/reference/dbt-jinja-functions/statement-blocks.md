:::tip Recommendation

We recommend using the [`run_query` macro](/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/run_query) instead of `statement` blocks. The `run_query` macro provides a more convenient way to run queries and fetch their results by wrapping `statement` blocks. You can use this macro to write more concise code that is easier to maintain.

:::

`statement`s are sql queries that hit the database and return results to your Jinja context. Hereâ€™s an example of a `statement` which gets all of the states from a users <Term id="table" />.

<File name='get_states_statement.sql'>

```sql
{%- call statement('states', fetch_result=True) -%}

    select distinct state from {{ ref('users') }}

{%- endcall -%}
```

</File>

The signature of the `statement` block looks like this:

```
statement(name=None, fetch_result=False, auto_begin=True)
```

__Args__:
 - `name` (string): The name for the result set returned by this statement
 - `fetch_result` (bool): If True, load the results of the statement into the Jinja context
 - `auto_begin` (bool): If True, open a transaction if one does not exist. If false, do not open a transaction.

Once the statement block has executed, the result set is accessible via the `load_result` function. The result object includes three keys:
- `response`: Structured object containing metadata returned from the database, which varies by adapter. E.g. success `code`, number of `rows_affected`, total `bytes_processed`, etc. Comparable to `adapter_response` in the [Result object](dbt-classes#result-objects).
- `data`: Pythonic representation of data returned by query (arrays, tuples, dictionaries).
- `table`: [Agate](https://agate.readthedocs.io/page/api/table.html) table representation of data returned by query.

<Changelog>

* `v0.19.0`: The `response` structured object replaced a `status` string that contained similar information.

</Changelog>

For the above statement, that could look like:

<File name='load_states.sql'>

```sql
{%- set states = load_result('states') -%}
{%- set states_data = states['data'] -%}
{%- set states_status = states['response'] -%}
```

</File>

The contents of the returned `data` field is a matrix. It contains a list rows, with each row being a list of values returned by the database. For the above example, this data structure might look like:

<File name='states.sql'>

```python
>>> log(states_data)

[
  ['PA'],
  ['NY'],
  ['CA'],
	...
]
```

</File>
