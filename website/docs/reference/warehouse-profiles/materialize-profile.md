## Connecting to Materialize with **dbt-materialize**

The dbt profile for Materialize is nearly identical to the [profile configuration for Postgres](postgres-profile):

<File name='profiles.yml'>

```yaml
dbt-materialize:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: materialize
      threads: 1
      host: [host]
      port: [port]
      user: [user]
      pass: [password]
      dbname: [database]
      schema: [name of your dbt schema]
```

## Supported Features

### Materializations

Type | Supported? | Details
-----|------------|----------------
view | YES | Creates a [view](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-view/#main).
materializedview | YES | Creates a [materialized view](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-materialized-view/#main).
table | YES | Creates a [materialized view](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-materialized-view/#main). (Actual table support pending [#5266](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/5266))
ephemeral | YES | Executes queries using CTEs.
incremental | NO | Use the `materializedview` materialization instead. Materialized views will always return up-to-date results without manual or configured refreshes. For more information, check out [Materialize documentation](https://materialize.com/docs/).

### Seeds

Running [`dbt seed`](commands/seed) will create a static materialized view from a CSV file. You will not be able to add to or update this view after it has been created. If you want to rerun `dbt seed`, you must first drop existing views manually with `drop view`.
