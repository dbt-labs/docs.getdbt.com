## Connection Methods

dbt-impala can connect to Apache Impala and Cloudera Data Platform clusters.

The [Impyla](https://github.com/cloudera/impyla/) library is used to establish connections to Impala.

Two transport mechanisms are supported:
- binary
- HTTP(S)

The default mechanism is `binary`. To use HTTP transport, use the boolean option `use_http_transport: [true / false]`.

## Authentication Methods

dbt-impala supports three authentication mechanisms:
- [`insecure`](#Insecure) No authentication is used, only recommended for testing.
- [`ldap`](#ldap) Authentication via LDAP
- [`kerbros`](#kerbros) Authentication via Kerberos (GSSAPI)

### Insecure

This method is only recommended if you have a local install of Impala and want to test out the dbt-impala adapter. 

<File name='~/.dbt/profiles.yml'>

```yaml
your_profile_name:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: impala
      host: localhost
      port: 21050
      dbname: [db name]  # this should be same as schema name provided below
      schema: [schema name]
      
```

</File>

### LDAP

LDAP allows you to authenticate with a username & password when Impala is [configured with LDAP Auth](https://impala.apache.org/docs/build/html/topics/impala_ldap.html). LDAP is supported over Binary & HTTP connection mechanisms.

This is the recommended authentication mechanism to use with Cloudera Data Platform.

<File name='~/.dbt/profiles.yml'>

```yaml
your_profile_name:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
     type: impala
     host: [host name]
     http_path: [optional, http path to Impala]
     port: [port]
     auth_type: ldap
     use_http_transport: [true / false]
     use_ssl: [true / false] # TLS should always be used with LDAP to ensure secure transmission of credentials
     username: [username]
     password: [password]
     dbname: [db name]  # this should be same as schema name provided below
     schema: [schema name]
```

</File>

### Kerberos

The Kerberos authentication mechanism uses GSSAPI to share Kerberos credentials when Impala is [configured with Kerberos Auth](https://impala.apache.org/docs/build/html/topics/impala_kerberos.html).

<File name='~/.dbt/profiles.yml'>

```yaml
your_profile_name:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: impala
      host: [hostname]
      port: [port]
      auth_type: [GSSAPI]
      kerberos_service_name: [kerberos service name]
      use_http_transport: true
      use_ssl: true # TLS should always be used with LDAP to ensure secure transmission of credentials
      dbname: [db name]  # this should be same as schema name provided below
      schema: [schema name]

```

## Installation and Distribution

dbt's adapter for Apache Impala is managed in its own repository, [dbt-impala](https://github.com/cloudera/dbt-impala). To use it, 
you must install the `dbt-impala` plugin.

### Using pip
The following commands will install the latest version of `dbt-impala` as well as the requisite version of `dbt-core` and `impyla` driver used for connections.

```
pip install dbt-impala
```
