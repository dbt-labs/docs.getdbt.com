Hi there,

Before I get to the goods, I just wanted to quickly flag that Coalesce is less than 3 weeks away! 😱 If you had to choose just ONE of the 60+ sessions on tap, consider [Tristan's keynote with A16z's Martin Casado](https://coalesce.getdbt.com/talks/keynote-how-big-is-this-wave/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=hs_email&utm_campaign=h2-2021_coalesce-2021_awareness&utm_content=connect_prod-2_&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9SoWbfj9_ZRDew6i8p8yand1JSmLh7yfridIrLwO7bgHTUmnbKcRp3AEKCO8pOytotdxAo).

It has two of my favorite elements:

1) Spice 🌶️

2) Not-actually-about-us 😅

Martin and Tristan will discuss something we've all probably considered with the latest wave of innovation (and funding) in our space:

*Is the modern data stack just another wave in a long string of trendy technologies, or is it somehow more permanent?*

Hear their take, and share your own by [registering here](https://coalesce.getdbt.com/talks/keynote-how-big-is-this-wave/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=hs_email&utm_campaign=h2-2021_coalesce-2021_awareness&utm_content=connect_prod-2_&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9SoWbfj9_ZRDew6i8p8yand1JSmLh7yfridIrLwO7bgHTUmnbKcRp3AEKCO8pOytotdxAo).
