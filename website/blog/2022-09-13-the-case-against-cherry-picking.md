## Why do people cherry pick into upper branches?

The simplest branching strategy for making code changes to your dbt project repository is to have a **single main branch** with your production-level code. To update the `main` branch, a developer will:

1. Create a new feature branch directly from the `main` branch
1. Make changes on said feature branch
1. Test locally
1. When ready, open a pull request to merge their changes back into the `main` branch

This approach – often referred to as “continuous deployment” or “direct promotion” – provides many benefits including:

- Fast promotion process to get new changes into production
- Simple branching strategy to manage

The main risk, however, is that your `main` branch can become susceptible to bugs that slip through the pull request approval process.

In order to have more intensive testing and QA before merging code changes into production, some organizations may decide to **create one or more branches between the feature branches and `main`**. For example, a single dbt project repository might have a hierarchy of 3 primary branches: `dev`, `staging`, and `prod`. To update the prod branch, a developer will:

1. Create a new feature branch directly from the `dev` branch
1. Make changes on that feature branch
1. Test locally
1. When ready, open a pull request to merge their changes back into the `dev` branch

In this hierarchical promotion, once a set of feature branches are vetted in `dev`:

5. The entire `dev` branch is merged into the `staging` branch

After a final review of the `staging` branch:

6. The entire `staging` branch is merged into the `prod` branch

While this approach—often referred to as “continuous delivery” or “indirect promotion”—is more complex, it allows for a higher level of protection for your production code. You can think of these additional branches as layers of protective armor. The more layers you have, the harder it will be to move quickly and nimbly on the battlefield, but you’ll also be less likely to sustain injuries. If you’ve ever played D&D, you’ll understand this tradeoff.

Because these additional branches slow down your development workflow, organizations may be tempted to add *more complexity* to increase their speed—selecting individual changes to merge into upper branches (in our example, `staging` and `prod`), rather than waiting to promote an entire branch. That’s right, I’m talking about the beast that is **cherry picking into upper branches**.

:::info What is cherry picking?

`git cherry-pick` is a git command that allows you to apply individual commits from one branch into another branch.

:::

In theory, cherry picking seems like a good solution: it allows you to select individual changes for promotion into upper branches to unblock developers and increase speed.

In practice, however, when cherry picking is used this way, it introduces more risk and complexity and (in my opinion) is not worth the tradeoff. Cherry picking into upper environments can lead to:

- Greater risk in breaking hierarchical relationship of primary branches
- Flawed testing practices that don’t account for dependent code changes
- Increase chance of merge conflicts, draining developer time and prone to human error

## If you’re not testing changes independently, you shouldn’t promote them independently

If you’ve attempted a branching strategy that involves cherry picking into upper environments, you’ve probably encountered a scenario like this, where feature branches are only tested in combination with others:

![Feature branches tested in combination with others](/img/blog/2022-09-13-the-case-against-cherry-picking/4_scenario_1.png)

1. Alex wants to make a code change, so they create a new branch from `dev` called `feature_alex`
1. Becca has a different code change she’s working on, so she creates a new branch from dev called `feature_becca`
1. Alex’s changes are approved, so they merge `feature_alex` into `dev`.
1. Becca’s changes are approved, so she merges `feature_becca` into `dev`.
1. Carol is working on something else, so she creates a new branch from `dev` called `feature_carol`.
1. Carol’s changes are approved, so she merges `feature_carol` into `dev`.
1. The testing team notices an issue with Carol’s new addition to `dev`.
1. Alex and Becca’s changes are urgent and need to be promoted soon, they can’t wait for Carol to fix her work. Alex and Becca cherry-pick their changes from `dev` into `staging`.
1. During final checks, the team notices an issue with Alex’s changes in `staging`.
1. Becca is adamant that her changes need to be promoted to production immediately. She can’t wait for Alex to fix their work. Becca cherry-picks her changes from `staging` into `prod`.

**What’s the problem?**

In the example above, the team has only ever tested `feature_becca` *in combination with* `feature_alex` —so there’s no guarantee that `feature_becca`’s changes will be successful on their own. What if `feature_becca` were relying on a change included in `feature_alex`? Because testing of branches is not conducted independently, it’s risky to merge independently.

## Feature branches contain more than meets the eye

Let’s imagine another version of the story, where Carol’s changes are the only ones that are ultimately merged into `prod`:

![Feature branches contain more than meets the eye...](/img/blog/2022-09-13-the-case-against-cherry-picking/5_scenario_2.png)

1. Alex wants to make a code change, so they create a new branch from `dev` called `feature_alex`.
1. Becca has a different code change she’s working on, so she creates a new branch from `dev` called `feature_becca`.
1. Alex’s changes are approved, so they merge `feature_alex` into `dev`.
1. Becca’s changes are approved, so she merges `feature_becca` into `dev`.
1. Carol is working on something else, so she creates a new branch from `dev` called `feature_carol`.
1. Carol’s changes are approved, so she merges `feature_carol` into `dev`.
1. The testing team approves the entire `dev` branch.
1. `dev` is merged into `staging`.
1. During final checks, the team notices an issue with Alex and Becca’s changes in `staging`.
1. Carol is adamant that her changes need to be promoted to production immediately. She can’t wait for Alex or Becca to fix their work. Carol cherry-picks her changes from `staging` into `prod`.

**What’s the difference?**

Because `feature_carol` was created *after* `feature_alex` and `feature_becca` were already merged back into `dev`, `feature_carol` is *dependent* on the changes made in the other two branches. `feature_carol` not only contains its own changes, it *also* carries the changes from `feature_alex` and `feature_becca`. Even if Carol recognizes this and only cherry-picks the *individual* *commits* from `feature_carol`, she’s still not in the clear because of the previously mentioned testing dependency. `feature_carol`’s commits have only ever been tested *in combination with* `feature_alex` and `feature_becca`.

## Repeated merge conflicts drain development time

In order to avoid this dependency issue, your team might have the idea to create feature branches directly from `prod` (instead of `dev`). If we imagine the previous scenario with this alteration, however, we can easily see why this doesn’t work either:

![Development branches made from prod](/img/blog/2022-09-13-the-case-against-cherry-picking/6_scenario_3.png)

1. Alex wants to make a code change, so they create a new branch from `prod` called `feature_alex`.
1. Becca has a different code change she’s working on, so she creates a new branch from `prod` called `feature_becca`.
1. Alex’s changes are approved, so they merge `feature_alex` into `dev`.
1. Becca’s changes are approved, so she merges `feature_becca` into `dev`.
1. Carol is working on something else, so she creates a new branch from `prod` called `feature_carol`.
1. Carol’s changes are approved, so she merges `feature_carol` into `dev`.
1. The testing team approves the entire `dev` branch.
1. `dev` is merged into `staging`.
1. During final checks, the team notices an issue with Alex and Becca’s changes in `staging`.
1. Carol is adamant that her changes need to be promoted to production immediately. She can’t wait for Alex or Becca to fix their work. Carol cherry-picks her changes from `staging` into `prod`.

Now, `feature_carol` only contains its individual changes—the team can merge her branch independently into `dev`, `staging`, and ultimately `prod` without worrying about accidentally pulling along the changes from the other two branches.

**What’s the problem?**

A new issue emerges, however, if `feature_alex` or `feature_becca` alter the *same lines of code* as `feature_carol`. When `feature_carol` is merged into each of the primary branches, Carol will have to solve merge conflicts every time in the exact same way to ensure the hierarchy of the branches remain consistent. This takes time and is prone to human error.

## What to do instead: The recommended branching strategy for multi-environment dbt projects

![Bernie is begging you to stop cherry picking](/img/blog/2022-09-13-the-case-against-cherry-picking/7_bernie.jpg)

In the end, **cherry picking into upper branches** is a branching strategy that causes more trouble than it’s worth.

Instead, if you decide to use a branching strategy that involves multiple primary branches (such as `dev`, `staging`, and `prod`):

- Protect your `dev` branch with a dbt cloud [CI job](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/cloud-enabling-continuous-integration)
- Ensure thorough code reviews (check out our recommended [PR template](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/analytics-pull-request-template))
- Only promote each primary branch hierarchically into each other

![Hierarchical branching strategy](/img/blog/2022-09-13-the-case-against-cherry-picking/2_multienvironment.png)

If issues arise during testing on the dev or staging branch, the developers should create additional branches as necessary to fix the bugs until the *entire* branch is ready to be promoted.

As mentioned previously, this approach does have a clear disadvantage—it might take longer to fix all of the bugs found during testing, which can lead to:

- Delayed deployments
- Code freezes on dev, creating a backup of out-dated feature branches waiting to be merged

Thankfully, we can mitigate these delays by doing rigorous testing on the *individual* feature branches, ensuring the team is extremely confident about the change *prior* to merging the feature branch into `dev`.

Additionally, developers may supplement the above workflow by creating hotfixes to quickly resolve bugs in upper environments

:::info What is a hotfix?

A `hotfix` is a branch that is created to quickly patch a bug typically in your production code. If a high-stakes bug was discovered in `prod`, a hotfix branch would be created from `prod`, then merged into `prod` as well as *all subordinate branches* (`dev` and `staging`) once the change has been approved. Similarly, if a high-stakes bug were discovered in `staging`, a hotfix branch would be created from `staging`, then merged into `staging` as well as *all subordinate branches* (`dev`) once the change has been approved. This allows you to fix a bug in an upper environment without having to wait for the next full promotion cycle, but also ensures the hierarchy of your primary branches is not lost.

:::

Even with its challenges, hierarchical branch promotion is the recommended branching strategy when handling multiple primary branches because it:

- Simplifies your development process: Your team runs more efficiently with less complex rules to follow
- Prevents merge conflicts: You save developer time by avoiding developers having to manually resolve sticky merge conflicts over and over
- Ensures the code that's tested is the code that is ultimately merged into production: You avoid crisis scenarios where unexpected bugs sneak into production

Now I’ll admit it: this blog post was mostly just a venting session, providing me a cathartic outlet to rage against cherry picking (my Slack dms are open if you want to see all of the memes that *didn’t* make it into this post).

And you may be left thinking… ok, jeez Grace, I won’t cherry pick into upper branches. But how do I *actually* set up my dbt project to properly use hierarchical branch promotion?

Don’t worry, a guide and training course are on the way ;)
