Adding [documentation](/docs/collaborate/documentation) to your project allows you to describe your models in rich detail, and share that information with your team. Here, we're going to add some basic documentation to our project.

1. Update your `models/schema.yml` file to include some descriptions, such as those below.

    <File name='models/schema.yml'>

    ```yaml
    version: 2

    models:
      - name: customers
        description: One record per customer
        columns:
          - name: customer_id
            description: Primary key
            tests:
              - unique
              - not_null
          - name: first_order_date
            description: NULL when a customer has not yet placed an order.

      - name: stg_customers
        description: This model cleans up customer data
        columns:
          - name: customer_id
            description: Primary key
            tests:
              - unique
              - not_null

      - name: stg_orders
        description: This model cleans up order data
        columns:
          - name: order_id
            description: Primary key
            tests:
              - unique
              - not_null
          - name: status
            tests:
              - accepted_values:
                  values: ['placed', 'shipped', 'completed', 'return_pending', 'returned']

    ```

    </File>

2. Run `dbt docs generate` to generate the documentation for your project. dbt introspects your project and your warehouse to generate a <Term id="json" /> file with rich documentation about your project.
