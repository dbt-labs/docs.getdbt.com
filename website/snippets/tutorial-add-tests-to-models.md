Adding [tests](/docs/build/tests) to a project helps validate that your models are working correctly.

To add tests to your project:

1. Create a new YAML file in the `models` directory, named `models/schema.yml`
2. Add the following contents to the file:

    <File name='models/schema.yml'>

    ```yaml
    version: 2

    models:
      - name: customers
        columns:
          - name: customer_id
            tests:
              - unique
              - not_null

      - name: stg_customers
        columns:
          - name: customer_id
            tests:
              - unique
              - not_null

      - name: stg_orders
        columns:
          - name: order_id
            tests:
              - unique
              - not_null
          - name: status
            tests:
              - accepted_values:
                  values: ['placed', 'shipped', 'completed', 'return_pending', 'returned']
          - name: customer_id
            tests:
              - not_null
              - relationships:
                  to: ref('stg_customers')
                  field: customer_id

    ```

    </File>

3. Run `dbt test`, and confirm that all your tests passed.

When you run `dbt test`, dbt iterates through your YAML files, and constructs a query for each test. Each query will return the number of records that fail the test. If this number is 0, then the test is successful.
