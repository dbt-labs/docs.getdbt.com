Let's start this section by creating a dbt Cloud account if you haven't already.

1. Navigate to [dbt Cloud](https://cloud.getdbt.com).
2. If you don't have a dbt Cloud account, create a new one, and verify your account via email.
3. If you already have a dbt Cloud account, you can create a new project from your existing account:
    1. Click the gear icon in the top-right, then click **Projects**.
    2. Click **+ New Project**.
4. You've arrived at the "Setup a New Project" page.
5. Type "Analytics" in the dbt Project Name field. You will be able to rename this project later.
6. Click **Continue**.
