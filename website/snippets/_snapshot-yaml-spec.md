:::info Use the latest snapshot syntax

In Versionless and dbt v1.9 and later, snapshots are defined in an updated syntax using a YAML file within your `snapshots/` directory (as defined by the [`snapshot-paths` config](/reference/project-configs/snapshot-paths)). For faster and more efficient management, consider the updated snapshot YAML syntax, [available in Versionless](/docs/dbt-versions/versionless-cloud) or [dbt Core v1.9 and later](/docs/dbt-versions/core).
