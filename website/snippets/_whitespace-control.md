<summary>ðŸ’¡ Use Jinja's whitespace control to tidy your macros!</summary>

When you're modifying macros in your project, you might notice extra white space in your code in the `target/compiled` folder.

You can remove unwanted spaces and lines with Jinja's [whitespace control](/faqs/Jinja/jinja-whitespace) by using a minus sign. For example, use `{{- ... -}}` or `{%- ... %}` around your macro definitions (such as `{%- macro generate_schema_name(...) -%} ... {%- endmacro -%}`).
