- Have a dbt Cloud Team or Enterprise [multi-tenant](/docs/cloud/about-cloud/regions-ip-addresses) deployment. Single-tenant coming soon.
- Have both your production and development environments running dbt version 1.6 or higher. Refer to [upgrade in dbt Cloud](/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-core-in-cloud) for more info.
- Use Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, or Redshift.
-  Create a successful run in the environment where you configure the Semantic Layer. 
   - **Note:** Semantic Layer currently supports the Deployment environment for querying. (_development querying experience coming soon_) 
- Set up the [Semantic Layer API](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-api-overview) in the integrated tool to import metric definitions. 
  - To access the API and query metrics in downstream tools, you must have a dbt Cloud [Team or Enterprise](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing/) account. dbt Core or Developer accounts can define metrics but won't be able to dynamically query them.<br />
- Understand [MetricFlow's](/docs/build/about-metricflow) key concepts, which powers the latest dbt Semantic Layer.
