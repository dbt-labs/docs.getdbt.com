- Have a dbt Cloud Team or Enterprise account. Single-tenant accounts should contact their account representative for setup.
- Ensure your production and development environments use [dbt version 1.6 or higher](/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-dbt-version-in-cloud).
- Use Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, or Redshift.
-  Create a successful run in the environment where you configure the Semantic Layer. 
   - **Note:** Semantic Layer supports querying in Deployment environments; development querying is coming soon.
- Understand [MetricFlow's](/docs/build/about-metricflow) key concepts powering the dbt Semantic Layer.  
- Note that the dbt Semantic Layer doesn't support SSH tunneling for [Postgres or Redshift](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/connect-redshift-postgresql-alloydb) connections.  It also doesn't support using [Single sign-on (SSO)](/docs/cloud/manage-access/sso-overview) for [production credentials](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/service-tokens#permissions-for-service-account-tokens), though SSO is supported for development user accounts.
