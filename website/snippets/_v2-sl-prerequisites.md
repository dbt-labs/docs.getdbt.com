- Have a dbt Cloud Team or Enterprise account. Suitable for both Multi-tenant and Single-tenant deployment. 
    - Note: Single-tenant accounts should contact their account representative for necessary setup and enablement.
- Have both your production and development environments running [dbt version 1.6 or higher](/docs/dbt-versions/upgrade-dbt-version-in-cloud).
- Use Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, or Redshift.
-  Create a successful run in the environment where you configure the Semantic Layer. 
   - **Note:** Semantic Layer currently supports the Deployment environment for querying. (_development querying experience coming soon_) 
- Set up the [Semantic Layer API](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-api-overview) in the integrated tool to import metric definitions. 
  - dbt Core or Developer accounts can define metrics but won't be able to dynamically query them.<br />
- Understand [MetricFlow's](/docs/build/about-metricflow) key concepts, which powers the latest dbt Semantic Layer.  
- Note that the dbt Semantic Layer doesn't yet support SSH tunneling for [Postgres or Redshift](/docs/cloud/connect-data-platform/connect-redshift-postgresql-alloydb) connections.  It also doesn't support using [Single sign-on (SSO)](/docs/cloud/manage-access/sso-overview) for Semantic Layer  [production credentials](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/service-tokens#permissions-for-service-account-tokens), however, SSO is supported for development user accounts.
