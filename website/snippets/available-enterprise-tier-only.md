:::caution Available for dbt Cloud Enterprise

Connecting an Azure DevOps cloud account is available for organizations using the dbt Cloud Enterprise tier. 

dbt Cloud's native Azure DevOps integration does not support Azure DevOps Server (on-premise). Instead, you can [import a project by git URL](/docs/cloud/git/import-a-project-by-git-url) to connect to an Azure DevOps Server.
