This section will guide you on how to use the Google Sheets integration. Query metrics using other tools:
- [First-class integrations](/docs/cloud-integrations/avail-sl-integrations) with Tableau, Hex, and more.
- The [dbt Semantic Layer APIs](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-api-overview).
- [Exports](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/exports) to expose tables of metrics and dimensions in your data platform and create a custom integration with tools like PowerBI.

To query your metrics using Google Sheets:
1. Make sure you have a [Gmail](http://gmail.com/) account.
2. To set up Google Sheets and query your metrics, follow the detailed instructions on [Google Sheets integration](/docs/cloud-integrations/semantic-layer/gsheets).
3. Start exploring and querying metrics!
   - Query a metric, like `order_total`, and filter it with a dimension, like `order_date`. 
   - You can also use the `group_by` parameter to group your metrics by a specific dimension.
