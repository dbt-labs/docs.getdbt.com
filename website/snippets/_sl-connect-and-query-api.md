You can query your metrics in a JDBC-enabled tool or use existing first-class integrations with the dbt Semantic Layer. 

- You must have a dbt Cloud Team or Enterprise account. Suitable for both Multi-tenant and Single-tenant deployment.
  - Single-tenant accounts should contact their account representative for necessary setup and enablement.
- To learn how to use the JDBC or GraphQL API and what tools you can query it with, refer to [dbt Semantic Layer APIs](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-api-overview).
    * To authenticate, you need to [generate a service token](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/service-tokens) with Semantic Layer Only and Metadata Only permissions.
    * Refer to the [SQL query syntax](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-jdbc#querying-the-api-for-metric-metadata) to query metrics using the API.  
- To learn more about the sophisticated integrations that connect to the dbt Semantic Layer, refer to [Available integrations](/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/avail-sl-integrations) for more info.
