The Google Sheets integration allows you to query your metrics using Google Sheets. This section will guide you on how to connect and use the Google Sheets integration. 

To query your metrics using Google Sheets:
1. Make sure you have a [Gmail](http://gmail.com/) account.
2. To set up Google Sheets and query your metrics, follow the detailed instructions on [Google Sheets integration](/docs/cloud-integrations/semantic-layer/gsheets).
3. Start exploring and querying metrics!
   - Query a metric, like `order_total`, and filter it with a dimension, like `order_date`. 
   - You can also use the `group_by` parameter to group your metrics by a specific dimension.
