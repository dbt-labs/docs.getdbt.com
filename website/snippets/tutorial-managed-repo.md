dbt Cloud uses Git for version control, but using a managed repository makes this easier. To set up a managed repository:

1. Under "Add repository from", select **Managed**.
2. Type a name for your repo such as `bbaggins-dbt-quickstart`
3. Click **Create**. It will take a few seconds for your repository to be created and imported.
4. Once you see the "Successfully imported repository," click **Continue**.
