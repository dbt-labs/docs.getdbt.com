When you develop in dbt Cloud, you can leverage [Git](/docs/collaborate/git-version-control) to version control your code.  

To connect to a repository, you can either set up a dbt Cloud-hosted [managed repository](/docs/collaborate/git/managed-repository) or directly connect to a [supported git provider](/docs/collaborate/git/connect-github). Managed repositories are a great way to trial dbt without needing to create a new repository.  In the long run, it's better to connect to a supported git provider to use features like automation and [continuous integration](/docs/deploy/cloud-ci-job).
