:::important Upgrade to access the latest dbt Semantic Layer

The dbt Semantic Layer has undergone a [significant revamp](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-semantic-layer-whats-next/), introducing new features such as dbt Semantic Layer APIs. The APIs integrate with data applications, such as Tableau and Google Sheets, to query metrics and unlock insights.

For users of the dbt Semantic Layer on version 1.5 or lower &mdash; Support for dbt Metrics and the legacy dbt Semantic Layer ends on December 15th, 2023. To access the latest features, migrate to the updated version using the [dbt Semantic Layer migration guide](/guides/sl-migration).

After December 15th, dbt Labs will no longer support these deprecated features, they will be removed from the dbt Cloud user interface, and their documentation removed from the docs site.
