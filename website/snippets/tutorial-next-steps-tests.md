Before moving on from testing, make a change and see how it affects your results:

* Write a test that fails, for example, omit one of the order statuses in the `accepted_values` list. What does a failing test look like? Can you debug the failure?
* Run the tests for one model only. If you grouped your `stg_` models into a directory, try running the tests for all the models in that directory.
* Use a [docs block](/docs/collaborate/documentation#using-docs-blocks) to add a Markdown description to a model.
