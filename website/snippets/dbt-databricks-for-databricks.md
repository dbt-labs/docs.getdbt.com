:::info If you're using Databricks, use `dbt-databricks`
If you're using Databricks, the `dbt-databricks` adapter is recommended over `dbt-spark`.
If you're still using dbt-spark with Databricks consider [migrating from the dbt-spark adapter to the dbt-databricks adapter](/guides/migration/tools/migrating-from-spark-to-databricks#migrate-your-dbt-projects).
