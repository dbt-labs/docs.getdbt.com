You must be part of the Owner group and have the correct [license](/docs/cloud/manage-access/seats-and-users) and [permissions](/docs/cloud/manage-access/enterprise-permissions) to set up the Semantic Layer at the environment and project level.
- Enterprise plan:
  - Developer license with Account Admin permissions, or
  - Owner with a Developer license, assigned Project Creator, Database Admin, or Admin permissions.
- Team plan: Owner with a Developer license.
- Free trial: You are on a free trial of the Team plan as an Owner, which means you have access to the dbt Semantic Layer.

### 1. Select environment

Select the environment where you want to enable the Semantic Layer:

1. Navigate to **Account settings** in the navigation menu.
2. On the **Settings** left sidebar, select the specific project you want to enable the Semantic Layer for.
3. In the **Project details** page, navigate to the **Semantic Layer** section. Select **Configure Semantic Layer**.

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/semantic-layer/new-sl-configure.jpg" width="70%" title="Semantic Layer section in the 'Project Details' page"/>

4. In the **Set Up Semantic Layer Configuration** page, select the deployment environment you want for the Semantic Layer and click **Save**. This provides administrators with the flexibility to choose the environment where the Semantic Layer will be enabled.

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/semantic-layer/sl-select-env.jpg" width="75%" title="Select the deployment environment to run your Semantic Layer against."/>

### 2. Add a credential and create service tokens

The dbt Semantic Layer uses [service tokens](/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/service-tokens) for authentication which are tied to an underlying data platform credential that you configure. The credential configured is used to execute queries that the Semantic Layer issues against your data platform. 

This credential controls the physical access to underlying data accessed by the Semantic Layer, and all access policies set in the data platform for this credential will be respected.

| Feature | Team plan | Enterprise plan |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| Service tokens | Can create multiple service tokens linked to one credential. | Can use multiple credentials and link multiple service tokens to each credential. Note that you cannot link a single service token to more than one credential. |
| Credentials per project | One credential per project. | Can [add multiple](#4-add-more-credentials) credentials per project. |
| Link multiple service tokens to a single credential | ✅ | ✅ |

*If you're on a Team plan and need to add more credentials, consider upgrading to our [Enterprise plan](https://www.getdbt.com/contact). Enterprise users can refer to [Add more credentials](#4-add-more-credentials) for detailed steps on adding multiple credentials.*

1. After selecting the deployment environment, you should see the **Credentials & service tokens** page. 
2. Click the **Add Semantic Layer credential** button. 
3. In the **1. Add credentials** section, enter the credentials specific to your data platform that you want the Semantic Layer to use.
   - Use credentials with minimal privileges. The Semantic Layer requires read access to the schema(s) containing the dbt models used in your semantic models for downstream applications
   - <SLEnvVars/>

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/semantic-layer/sl-add-credential.jpg" width="55%" title="Add credentials and map them to a service token. " />

4. After adding credentials, scroll to **2. Map new service token**.
5. Name the token and ensure the permission set includes 'Semantic Layer Only' and 'Metadata Only'.
6. Click **Save**. Once the token is generated, you won't be able to view this token again so make sure to record it somewhere safe.

:::info
- Team plans can create multiple service tokens that link to a single underlying credential, but each project can only have one credential.
- Enterprise plans can [add multiple credentials](#4-add-more-credentials) and map those to service tokens for tailored access.

### 3. View connection detail
1. Go back to the **Project details** page for connection details to connect to downstream tools.
2. Copy and share the environment ID, service token, host, as well as the service token name to the relevant teams for BI connection set up. If your tool uses the GraphQL API, save the GraphQL API host information instead of the JDBC URL. 

    For info on how to connect to other integrations, refer to [Available integrations](/docs/cloud-integrations/avail-sl-integrations).

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/semantic-layer/sl-configure-example.jpg" width="50%" title="After configuring, you'll be provided with the connection details to connect to you downstream tools." />

### 4. Add more credentials <Lifecycle status="enterprise"/>
dbt Cloud Enterprise plans can optionally add multiple credentials and map them to service tokens, offering more granular control and tailored access for different teams, which can then be shared to relevant teams for BI connection setup. These credentials control the physical access to underlying data accessed by the Semantic Layer.

We recommend configuring credentials and service tokens to reflect your teams and their roles. For example, create tokens or credentials that align with your team's needs, such as providing access to finance-related schemas to the Finance team.

Note that: 
- Admins can link multiple service tokens to a single credential within a project, but each service token can only be linked to one credential per project.
- When you send a request through the APIs, the service token of the linked credential will follow access policies of the underlying view and tables used to build your semantic layer requests.
- <SLEnvVars/>

To add multiple credentials and map them to service tokens:

1. After configuring your environment, on the **Credentials & service tokens** page, click the **Add Semantic Layer credential** button to create multiple credentials and map them to a service token.
2. In the **1. Add credentials** section, fill in the data platform's credential fields. We recommend using “read-only” credentials.
<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/semantic-layer/sl-add-credential.jpg" width="55%" title="Add credentials and map them to a service token. " />

3. In the **2. Map new service token** section, map a service token to the credential you configured in the previous step. dbt Cloud automatically selects the service token permission set you need (Semantic Layer Only and Metadata Only).

4. To add another service token during configuration, click **Add Service Token**. 
5. You can link more service tokens to the same credential later on in the **Semantic Layer Configuration Details** page. To add another service token to an existing Semantic Layer configuration, click **Add service token** under the **Linked service tokens** section.
6. Click **Save** to link the service token to the credential. Remember to copy and save the service token securely, as it won't be viewable again after generation.
<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/semantic-layer/sl-credentials-service-token.jpg" width="90%" title="Use the configuration page to manage multiple credentials or link or unlink service tokens for more granular control."/>

7. To delete a credential, go back to the **Credentials & service tokens** page.
8. Under **Linked Service Tokens**, click **Edit** and, select **Delete Credential** to remove a credential.

   When you delete a credential, any service tokens mapped to that credential in the project will no longer work and will break for any end users.

## Delete configuration
You can delete the entire Semantic Layer configuration for a project. Note that deleting the Semantic Layer configuration will remove all credentials and unlink all service tokens to the project. It will also cause all queries to the Semantic Layer to fail.

Follow these steps to delete the Semantic Layer configuration for a project:

1. Navigate to the **Project details** page.
2. In the **Semantic Layer** section, select **Delete Semantic Layer**. 
3. Confirm the deletion by clicking **Yes, delete semantic layer** in the confirmation pop up.

To re-enable the dbt Semantic Layer setup in the future, you will need to recreate your setup configurations by following the [previous steps](#set-up-dbt-semantic-layer). If your semantic models and metrics are still in your project, no changes are needed. If you've removed them, you'll need to set up the YAML configs again.

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/semantic-layer/sl-delete-config.jpg" width="90%" title="Delete the Semantic Layer configuration for a project."/>

## Additional configuration

 The following are the additional flexible configurations for Semantic Layer credentials.

### Unlink service tokens
- Unlink a service token from the credential by clicking **Unlink** under the **Linked service tokens** section. If you try to query the Semantic Layer with an unlinked credential, you'll experience an error in your BI tool because no valid token is mapped.

### Manage from service token page
**View credential from service token**
- View your Semantic Layer credential directly by navigating to the **API tokens** and then **Service tokens** page. 
- Select the service token to view the credential it's linked to. This is useful if you want to know which service tokens are mapped to credentials in your project.

**Create a new service token**
- From the **Service tokens** page, create a new service token and map it to the credential(s) (assuming the semantic layer permission exists). This is useful if you want to create a new service token and directly map it to a credential in your project.
- Make sure to select the correct permission set for the service token (Semantic Layer Only and Metadata Only).
