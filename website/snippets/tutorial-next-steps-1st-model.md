Before moving on from building your first models, make a change and see how it affects your results:

* Write some bad SQL to cause an error â€” can you debug the error?
* Run only a single model at a time. For more information, see [Syntax overview](/reference/node-selection/syntax).
* Group your models with a `stg_` prefix into a `staging` subdirectory. For example,  `models/staging/stg_customers.sql`.
  * Configure your `staging` models to be views.
  * Run only the `staging` models.
